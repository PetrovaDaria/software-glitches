    "text": "A FLYING expert has warned people who buy a drone for Christmas that the devices could have the same effect as a bird strike if they collide with an aircraft.\n\nMatt Williams, 32, a former helicopter pilot, said people should avoid using the popular flying machines in their back gardens and could cause serious injury if they did not abide by strict safety rules.\n\nThe ex-RAF Benson instructor runs Crowmarsh Gifford-based Aerial Motion Pictures, which runs training courses for people using drones, and sells them.\n\nThe father-of-two, who runs the company with wife Natalie, said: \"Back in 2008 I was flying a Puma helicopter in Iraq at about 150ft and there was a bird strike \u2013 a seagull hit me in the chest and knocked me unconscious and my co-pilot had to make an emergency landing.\n\n\"We could have been killed. The bird strike blew the door off the helicopter, and a drone hitting an aircraft could have a similar effect.\n\n\"Drone sales do increase at Christmas time and people who fly them need to know the regulations and abide by them.\n\n\"You can not fly a drone within 50 metres of people, vessels, vehicles or structures so for most people flying one in your back garden would be ruled out.\n\n\"Four hundred feet is the maximum height for a drone and without a permission for commercial operation you need to stay 150 metres away from congested areas.\"\n\nAerial Motion Pictures was one of the UK\u2019s first companies providing practical knowledge needed for full Civil Aviation Authority Commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle certification to fly a drone.\n\nThe firm offers commercial training courses for individuals and companies who use drones, and also sells drones to the public, as well as businesses.\n\nMr Williams was a helicopter instructor with the RAF for 13 years, rising to the rank of Flight Lieutenant before he left to concentrate on his business.\n\nHe added: \"Lots of people buy drones online at Christmas time but they need to be aware of the restrictions and regulations.\n\n\"If people buy a drone at this time of year they should take great care \u2013 they need to know the regulations and make sure they know how to fly the drone safely.\"\n\nMr Williams said large drones with a diameter of about 1.5m could cost from \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000.\n\nA training course run by the company called Icarus costs \u00a31,000 for two days or \u00a31,700 for three days.\n\nThe company, which offers a range of commercial drone licensing courses as well as aerial filming, photography and retail services for companies, is expanding.\n\nMr Williams said: \"We are franchising our training courses out to Canada and they will be run by about 20 staff.\"\n\nIn September last year Thames Valley Police revealed that 31 incidents involving drones had been reported in the two years up to September 2015 but more recent figures have not been released.",

    "title": "Body Condition Scoring \u2014 Hands-On Help for Your Horse",
    "text": "It's odd how two people can look at the same horse and view it with a different eye. One person may regard a horse as fat, but to the other it may appear just right. One might describe a horse as \"ribby,\" but in the eyes of another, its lean and fit. While it's customary for some horse owners to \"eyeball\" their horses to determine ideal weight, this leaves room for error, which can seriously affect your horse's health. Instead, there's a better way.\n\nBy Barbara Sheridan/Equine Guelph\n\nSince the mid-1980s, veterinarians and equine nutritionists alike have employed a system to measure fat coverage in horses with a scientific process called Body Condition Scoring as a more objective way to assess a horse's weight. Developed by Don Henneke, Ph.D. during his graduate study at Texas A&M University in 1979, Body Condition Scoring for Horses (BSC) was designed as a ranking system and remains the most reliable tool in determining a horse's body condition. If done on a regular basis, it is an excellent way to monitor the nutritional wellbeing of your horse over time.\n\nThe Henneke Scoring System\n\nBCS is a numbering system that uses a scale of 1 through 9 to describe the amount of fat and muscle a horse is carrying. A score of 1 is considered to be a poor or emaciated horse with no body fat, while a 9 is extremely fat or obese. Application of this method assists in evaluating a horse's body condition no matter the breed, age, body type or sex.\n\n\"The 1 to 9 scale is scientifically published and accepted, and has been in use for many years since Dr. Henneke developed it,\" said Gayle Ecker, director of Equine Guelph at the University of Guelph. \"However, this body condition score method is not a subject that is common knowledge. While it is generally included in most courses on horse care and nutrition, there are many horse owners that have not been exposed to this system of assessment and fewer still that have had structured training on it.\"\n\n\"Many may not be aware of the value of this scientific tool, and there are some who feel they can quite adequately eyeball the horse. Proper training for this [Henneke BCS] hands-on technique is important for its consistent use.\"\n\nThrough the use of physical palpation (use of hands to feel for areas of fat coverage) and visual assessment of anatomical sites, six specific areas of the horse's body are assessed - neck, withers, loin, tail head, ribs and shoulder. The scores are then totaled up and divided by six to obtain a more accurate score. The resulting number would be the horse's rating on the Henneke Body Scoring Condition Chart.\n\nThe 2013 Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Equines recommends BCS as a tool for determining if an animal is too thin, too fat or in ideal condition and provides information on each individual score from 1 to 9. According to the Code, a BCS of 4 to 6 is recommended for most horses, miniature horses and ponies. However, this rating would be dependent upon the animal's purpose, breed and life stage. The Code is also now being utilized by the OSPCA in assessing potential equine welfare cases.\n\nThe Difference Between Weight and Condition\n\nIn the past, some horse owners have applied other options to keep tabs on their horse's weight through the use of portable scales, which are costly, and weight taping. However, these methods just provide a measurement of the horse's body weight, not its condition. In addition, depending on how the tape is applied in the heart girth area, weight tapes can be very inaccurate.\n\nEcker notes that weight alone does not give us enough information, as a fat horse and a well-muscled horse can be of the same weight, but as in humans, muscle weighs more than fat. Instead, applying the BCS technique of examining the six areas where fat is deposited on a horse's body will help determine the body condition score in order to assist with the horse's overall nutrient requirements.\n\n\"Weight determination is important for feeding according to weight and growth, and for specific medications that are administered by the vet relative to the weight of the horse,\" Ecker said. \"However, weight alone does not even come close to telling the story of nutritional balance. If we had two growing boys that both weighed the same weight, what would that tell us? One could be very tall and slim and the other could be very short and carry more weight than is advisable, but both weigh the same.\"\n\nWhen measuring a horse's condition in order to maintain an ideal BCS, Henderson notes that this practice should be done on a regular basis.\n\n\"The general rule is that what you see today is what you fed two to four weeks ago,\" said Brianne Henderson, DVM, who specializes in ambulatory horse sport medicine and emergency and critical care at Toronto Equine Hospital. \"For that reason, I recommend horses that are healthy and in good work be assessed once per month through the BCS method. If you are trying to make a change, either weight gain or loss, then the horse should be assessed every other week.\"\n\nA graduate of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh, Scotland, Henderson also furthered her trained as a hospital intern at Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. Most recently, she was the Assistant Team Veterinarian for Team Canada at the World Equestrian Games in Lexington. She points out that in addition to careful record keeping, documenting with photographs of your horse is also an immense help when trying to make a change in body weight and condition.\n\n\"It gives you a concrete visual to compare to when you are three to six months down the road,\" Henderson said.\n\nToo Fat or Too Thin?\n\nOnce a person becomes properly trained with Henneke's 1 to 9 scoring system, determining optimal body condition can be simple no matter the horse's age or breed. \"Breed cannot be used to justify a skinny horse or fat horse, as the system is designed to look at fat cover, and this is irrespective of age or breed,\" Ecker says. \"There is a healthy range of scores from 4 to 7, and where your horse falls within that narrow margin can be different depending on the use of the horse. For example, a broodmare going into the winter can be a 7, as this will help keep up her body weight during the cold of the winter. However, an athletic horse should be a 4 or 5, as it is not desirable for that horse to be carrying excess weight when they are running, jumping, turning, and more, as this extra weight puts more stress on the joints, ligaments and tendons.\"\n\nWhile a horse rated 1- 3 on the Henneke scale is too thin or dangerously thin and easy to spot as a case you would report to the SPCA for a possible neglect scenario, many horse owners have difficulty acknowledging that their horse is also at risk should it rate at the other end of the scale with an 8 or 9.\n\n\"Much the same as in people, viewing obesity as a disease in horses is a more recent revelation,\" Henderson said. \"With the amount of current research being focused on the impact of fat cells on the hormones and metabolism of animals, specifically insulin resistance and equine metabolic syndrome, we must start to manage our horses in a manner which ensures their longevity and reduces the risk of colic, laminitis and orthopaedic disease worsened by a high body condition.\"\n\nShe notes that there is a strong association between feeding good food as a demonstration of love and status, and as a result, Equine Metabolic Syndrome (insulin resistance) is becoming more commonly diagnosed amongst our horse population.\n\n\"The cresty necks and chronic laminitis associated with this disease can be hugely detrimental to a horse's athletic career and general welfare,\" Henderson said. \"What we must remember is that the original horse survived on the poor quality pasture of Mongolia. This is what their system is designed for. While the elite athlete and geriatric will require additional nutritional support, the majority of backyards horses would likely do better with a diet higher in plain forage than concentrates.\"\n\nA horse that is too thin or too fat is prone to colic, illness and disease. By understanding your horse's body condition through the use of Henneke's Body Condition Scoring, you'll be in a better position to prevent any problems that may arise.\n\n\"If you are concerned about your horse's body condition, consult your regular veterinarian to ensure that all other systems are in working order such as teeth, parasite load, and hoof balance,\" Henderson said. \"They will be able to help you make a plan for any safe weight loss or gain.\"\n\nThe Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Equines, which includes Henneke's Body Condition Scoring system, can be viewed or downloaded at: nfacc.ca/codes-of-practice/equine.\n\nSign up for our free e-newsletter at EquineGuelph.ca which will deliver monthly welfare tips throughout 2014 and announce tools to aid all horse owners in carrying out their 'Full-Circle-Responsibility' to our beloved horses.

NXT is coming to the Empress Ballroom\n\nTriple H - one of the industry\u2019s biggest names and the son-in-law of WWE chairman Vince McMahon - visited London to announce the tournament.\n\nHe was joined by Blackpool\u2019s own grappling great William Regal, who is now a talent scout for the company, and also played a hand in the decision.\n\nHHH explained the contest would be held over two nights on Saturday and Sunday, January 14 and 15, and would feature 16 top wrestlers from the UK and Ireland.\n\nHe also revealed it would air live on the WWE Network - WWE\u2019s subscription service, which includes all their pay-per-views - at 8pm local time.\n\nTriple H\n\nThe competitors lucky enough to be involved include two local lads from Blackpool who are stalwarts of the North West wrestling scene.\n\nSam Gradwell and James Drake regularly appear at shows in Wigan, Morecambe, Preston, St Helens, Manchester and Liverpool. Gradwell, aka Ricky J McKenzie, is a a 6ft 1in chiselled high flyer, who was previously the heavyweight champion of Wigan\u2019s Grand Pro Wrestling.\n\nDrake, who held this title for nearly a year, previously working under the name JD Sassoon and was one half of the Blackpool Blonds tag team.\n\nHe and his equally well-coiffed partner Axl Rage ruled Manchester\u2019s FutureShock Wrestling, while infuriating fans with their dirty tactics.\n\nThey have paid their dues performing in clubs, theatres and sports halls up and down the country, but now have the chance to excel on a global stage. Put simply, this is the biggest opportunity of their careers. The world will be watching and if they impress, they will receive more bookings and could even earn a full-time contract with WWE.\n\nThe boost to the local economy is also obvious.\n\nThe shows sold out in less than 24 hours and WWE fans will flock to Blackpool from across Europe - booking hotels, visiting shops, restaurants and enjoying all of the famous attractions the town has to offer over the weekend.\n\nIt\u2019s an event which could change the lives of the lucky few selected to take part and one that British grappling fans are unlikely to ever forget.\n\nThe two-day, 16-competitor, single-elimination tournament will be held at the Empress Ballroom, taking place on Saturday and Sunday, January 14 and 15.\n\nTickets have now sold out. www.livenation.co.uk.",

    "title": "Residents slam suggestion to scrap Abingdon Health and Wellbeing Centre after pensioners sob at proposals (From Herald Series)",
    "text": "A CARE home worker has slammed proposals to replace a day centre after pensioners 'cried their eyes out' about its potential closure.\n\nRachel Pitts said she was 'absolutely shocked' by Oxfordshire County Council's suggestion to scrap Abingdon Health and Wellbeing Centre and introduce a new service that might not have a dedicated physical base in the town.\n\nThe Audlett Drive centre is one of 22 building-based daytime centres for the elderly and disabled that the council is set to replace with a community support service, saving between \u00a32.4m and \u00a33.4m.\n\nAbingdon Court Care Home activity coordinator Ms Pitts, who attended a consultation session last week about the new service, said: \"There were people there in their 80s and 90s crying their eyes out. They could be stuck in their house for weeks on end and not see anyone.\n\n\"The day centre is about friendship and companionship. People are more and more isolated in their homes and they all look forward to going, they are like a little family there.\"\n\nLast year the council proposed cutting its entire \u00a33m budget for daytime support for older people but unveiled revised plans this month after campaigners piled on pressure.\n\nIt pledged to continue a core service for people with assessed eligible needs through personal budgets and is consulting on two models to replace the 22 centres.\n\nThe most similar would introduce eight multi-functional hubs serving the elderly and people with disabilities or dementia, working alongside a smaller outreach service. One centre would be in Abingdon but not necessarily in the same building.\n\nThe other model proposed, however, would champion 'outreach care' and utilise community facilities such as libraries to offer services, with four bases reserved for those with complex needs. In that case, Abingdon's nearest base would be in Oxford or Didcot.\n\nAppleford Drive resident Norma Queralt, whose 95-year-old mother used the Abingdon day centre for several years, said it would be a 'great loss' if it closed.\n\nShe said: \"It was pivotal in allowing my parents access to other people. It was a lifeline for my dad who just needed to make some new friends.\"\n\nShe stressed that transport is a key problem for people whose mobility means they struggle to access other services.\n\nMilton Heights resident Lynda Walters said her 90-year-old mum Bella Keen, who has dementia, relishes the social interaction and nutritious hot meals she gets at the Abingdon centre.\n\nThe 63-year-old said: \"People need to get out; they are prisoners in their own homes and get lonely and depressed and frustrated.\"\n\nA decision on the two options will not be made until February and funding will continue for the current system until the end of August 2017.\n\nTo comment on the consultation click here.\n\nThe council has stressed that there are about 150 community-run daytime services in the county that do not receive any of its funding.\n\nOf 47 services that do get its funding, their annual grants will be cut under the new system from \u00a3992,000 to \u00a3250,000.",

    "text": "Savage Love Husbandry\n\nJoe Newton\n\nI'm a 37-year-old gay man who just got out of an abusive relationship. We were together five years, moved to Portland together, got married three years ago, yada, yada, yada. He suffered a traumatic injury earlier this year, which led to PTSD, which led to a nervous breakdown, which led to our savings being depleted, which led him to leave me in October. He moved back to the other side of the country, and I'm broke and on my own in a strange city. I saw your dirty film festival when it played here, and it made me realize something: At my age, I should still be enjoying myself and evolving sexually. I was unhappy in my marriage for the last two years, but sexually I was unhappy for a long time. Recently, I had a decent one-night stand. It was a drunken, stoned hot mess, but it got the job done\u2014and there was no guilt on my part, which to me signifies that it really is over with my ex. But I can't help feeling like I'm starting over. Not just dating, but starting over with my sex life and my writing. My ex had me switch from LGBT media\u2014which I am very good at\u2014to copywriting, which sucks but is \"steadier.\" The point is: I want so much sexually, because I've been starved physically and psychologically, but I don't know where to begin. I feel like my marriage eviscerated me sexually. Not just the sex part of it, but the parts of my homosexuality that felt important to my personality, not just my turn-ons. Help.\n\nGrieving And Yearning Man Asking Nicely\n\nYou're not too old to enjoy yourself and evolve sexually, GAYMAN\u2014you're never too old to enjoy yourself or evolve, sexually or otherwise. But it takes time to bounce back after a committed LTR ends traumatically. So don't rush yourself. But as soon as you can\u2014sooner than perhaps it feels right\u2014you'll need to get out there. You'll need to actively and intentionally reconnect to your homosexuality and the ways in which it shaped and continues to inform your personality, your perspective, and your joy.\n\nAnd now some random tips...\n\nI'm not being look-ist or body-fascist here\u2014this isn't about having Instagrammable abs or the best torso on Grindr\u2014but join a gym, GAYMAN. Or take up a sport that kicks your ass, cardio-wise. Forcing your body to outrun your brain is a good way to get back in touch with yourself physically, emotionally, and sexually. And exercising\u2014again, I'm not talking abs here\u2014is good for us. It's a natural antidepressant. It gets blood pumping into our extremities. (Your dick is an extremity.) And it gets us out of our heads. It also creates a social space, if you do it regularly, where you can make friends and connections without booze or drugs or the scourge of dance music.\n\nIf the gym isn't for you, ride a bike. If biking isn't for you, run. If running isn't for you, walk. Just get your ass moving.\n\nGo volunteer somewhere, anywhere. Like someone or other once said, it's hard to feel sorry for yourself when you're making yourself useful. Go volunteer at the ACLU or Planned Parenthood, do some copywriting for an LGBT civil-rights organization, find out what orgs are working with immigrants in your community and ask them what kind of help they need.\n\nPlease don't succumb to meth or any of the other stupid drugs. Pot and alcohol\u2014in moderation\u2014aren't stupid drugs.\n\nReach out to friends you lost touch with over the last five years, apologize for letting these relationships go, and ask if they'd like to reconnect. Not all will, GAYMAN\u2014some might be too angry to reconnect right now (you may hear from them later), some might not have any extra friendship bandwidth right now (ditto). Focus on friends who want to reconnect, and don't be bitter about friends who don't.\n\nMasturbate. A lot. And don't use porn every single time\u2014try using your imagination, flip through the ol' solodex. Be open to new experiences. Ask yourself where you've always wanted to go. Pick a big gay event you've always wanted to attend\u2014gay days at Disneyland, International Mr. Leather in Chicago, the World Series of Beer Pong in Las Vegas\u2014and start setting money aside so you'll have that trip to look forward to.\n\nGood luck, GAYMAN.\n\nI'm a 44-year-old married gay male. I recently found out my 30-year-old husband has been sending dick pics to randoms on Grindr. He says he doesn't remember who he sent pics to, or why, other than I was working late and he was drunk and pissed at me. I want to be mature about this, but I'm really hurt. We've been together more than four years and married six months. We have a closed, monogamous relationship. He says he's been faithful, and I believe him. I'm struggling to trust him, however. Am I overreacting?\n\nHelp Understanding Relationship Trauma\n\nWhich would you rather have, HURT: This particular husband (aka the man you married) or a husband (a generic husband) who wouldn't, couldn't, and didn't send dick pics to randoms on Grindr? Given a choice between a perfect, flawless, blameless but imaginary husband and the imperfect, flawed, living, breathing husband you've got, which would you pick?\n\nPersonally, I recommend choosing actual-and-flawed husbands over perfect-and-imaginary ones. (I'm not telling you to do anything I haven't done and that my own husband hasn't done.)\n\nWith that said, HURT, and hopefully with that choice made, your husband needs to drop the \"I was mad at you for working late\" bullshit and take responsibility for his actions. Drunk may have played a role, as booze is the great disinhibitor, but swapping dick pics isn't something reasonable dick-having people do in response to run-of-the-mill annoyances. Your husband sent those pics because he enjoys showing off the goods. Your husband has an exhibitionistic streak.\n\nSo what to do about it? You could forbid it, HURT, but creating a little space in our marriages for pleasures we may not share or fully understand\u2014making accommodations instead of issuing threats\u2014can make our marriages stronger, not weaker, less contentious and therefore less brittle. If swapping pics makes your husband feel desirable, and he plows that sexual energy into you... not only aren't you being betrayed, you're benefiting.\n\nIf I were you, HURT, I would grant him this small zone of erotic autonomy.\n\nI'm a Canadian gay man, married eight years to a man with a thing for men spitting in his face. It's a degradation thing (of course), and I would do it for him but it can't be me. It can't be someone he loves, someone who loves him, it has to be someone he doesn't know, someone who regards him with contempt. He finds guys to do this for him on the hookup apps, and I don't have a problem with it. I do have a problem leaning in for a kiss when his face reeks of some other man's spit.

    "text": "AFC Fylde goalkeeper Rhys Taylor admits his side just weren\u2019t good enough at Brackley Town on Tuesday, when they crashed out of the FA Trophy 4-0 in a humbling replay.\n\nThe Coasters trailed by three goals after a lacklustre first- half-display, and despite ringing the changes at the interval they conceded a fourth and struggled to find their usual firepower in front of goal.\n\nDave Challinor\u2019s Coasters lead the pack in National League North by seven points heading into the festive fixtures, but they have suffered early exits from both the FA Cup and now the FA Trophy.\n\nTaylor expressed his concern at the number of goals his side are shipping this campaign and insists something has to change. It was obviously a tough night for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nowhere to hide \u2013 we simply weren\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\nThis was only Fylde\u2019s third loss all season, following narrow 1-0 defeats at Alfreton in the FA Cup and at Tamworth in the league.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we have experienced anything like that this season,\u201d added Taylor, \u201c so it\u2019s important we put it behind us and move on.\n\n\u201cIt is happening week in, week out that I\u2019m having to make too many saves in a game and it has got to change.\n\n\u201cWe have been very good this season, but we have been conceding too many goals and I think a result like that was coming.\n\n\u201cYou never like to lose any game because it\u2019s good to keep momentum. There were a few changes to the team on Tuesday but the team the manager put out was more than capable of getting a result.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over now, so we have to concentrate on the league. We have a massive few weeks coming up, so we must learn from the defeat and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nFylde have prided themselves on a strong defensive record over recent seasons but have kept only three clean sheets this term.\n\nAnd Taylor pulled no punches when asked why he thinks that is .\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can compare records from season to season because the players change and the league changes.\n\n\u201cBut without wanting to sound too harsh, there are people out there who are too concerned about looking good rather than defending properly at times.\u201d\n\nFylde travel to Gloucester City this Saturday ahead of the festive derby double-header against Chorley.\n\nAnd former Chelsea stopper Taylor insists it is time for a few of his team-mates to \u201cstand up and be counted\u201d.\n\n\u201cGloucester have given us a couple of tough games already this season and those are the kind of games in which people now need to stand up and be counted, especially after a result like we had on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPeople need to show some bottle now.\n\n\u201cWe have got ourselves into a fantastic position this season and we cannot afford to let that slip or become complacent.\u201d\n\nDANIEL AGNEW",

    "title": "Which Wolf Are You Feeding?",
    "text": "Which Wolf Are You Feeding?\n\nBy Don G. ArcherOn Nov. 10, 2016, the wolves were at the door in Lake County, Ind., for Sheriff John Buncich. FBI Agents were raiding his office over concerns of corruption charges centered on allegations of bribery for contracts for towing companies; a pay-to-play scheme.Little more than a month later, Lake County Police Chief Timothy Downs (Buncich's boss) plead guilty to charges that he solicited campaign donations from tow operators in exchange for more territory. Downs said he did it to keep his job, so that he would continue to receive a salary. Buncich has yet to come clean.We condemn corruption from all quarters; but when it emanates from positions of authority like law enforcement it's especially heinous.How and why did it happen?Another story might help us understand:A wise grandmother was tucking her grandson into bed when he begged her to tell him a story. She agreed and decided to tell him the one about the two wolves who battle.She starts by describing how everyone in the world has two wolves that live inside. These wolves are constantly battling for dominance over us.One of the wolves is jealous and full of envy. He's malicious and has a fixed mindset. He believes that the world is cold and full of bad people, and that he must do whatever it takes, right or wrong, to get and stay on top. He's very negative and nothing good ever happens for him.Then there's the other wolf who's completely the opposite. He's very powerful and operates out of empathy, love and positivity. He believes that anything can be accomplished if you give it your all and put your heart into it. Many good things happen for him.At this point in the story the grandson begins to drift off to sleep but doesn't want to miss out on the ending. He stops his grandmother and looks up at her and asks, \"Grandmother, which wolf wins the battle?\" The grandmother smiles and leans in close to the boy's face, and says, \"The one you feed.\"It's apparent that these law enforcement officials were feeding the wrong wolf. It would be a mistake to just let the story lie there.What about the towing companies involved? It takes two to tango.Although other towing companies were involved, only William Szarmach, of CSA Towing was indicted. He faces charges of wire fraud and bribery. \"Individual A,\" the owner of another towing company involved, cooperated with prosecutors and will, seemingly, avoid further litigation.Before this sting occurred, both towing company owners, and law enforcement officials alike, probably believed what they were doing was justified. It was for the furtherance of their businesses and their careers. The towers were looking for more territory, which meant more money. The officers needed to be re-elected so they could maintain status and power.Could it be that the desire for these things was wrong?Rather than blaming the result of their actions on the want for more, maybe we should look elsewhere. We all want to do the best we can in any endeavor; there's nothing wrong with that. What was wrong was their method of getting there.For the towers involved, it probably didn't start on day one. They didn't intend to go down that road. Most likely it was a slow erosion of the soul through months and years of seeing all that is wrong with the world\u2014and then letting it seep inside. A continuous feeding of the jealous and envious wolf, while starving the good wolf. Then, like a bolt of lightning, an opportunity presents itself, a way to move forward.Though it was against the law, they succumbed ... because the bad wolf was stronger.In the case of the officers involved, it was probably the same story. Pride, and fear of loss overrode what was instinctively wrong and outside the law\u2014and they fell.It could be argued that the officers involved should face a higher degree of punishment than the towers. If the door weren't opened there would be no case.But does placing a higher degree of blame do any of us any good?When we point to people and circumstances outside ourselves as reasons why we are where we are, rather than accepting responsibility for what we've become, we're feeding the wrong wolf.American Towman Field Editor-Midwest Don G.

    "text": "A 29-year-old cyber criminal from Sussex has been jailed for his involvement in a crime syndicate that stole \u00a3840,000 from bank accounts across the world.\n\nThis follows an investigation by the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Falcon Cyber Crime Unit.\n\nTomasz Skowron of Meredith Road, Worthing was sentenced to five years and three months\u2019 imprisonment on Monday, December 19 at Croydon Crown Court.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, fraud and money laundering offences, a spokesperson for Metropolitan Police said.\n\nSkowron was linked to a major online banking fraud after detectives from the Met\u2019s Falcon (Fraud and Linked Crime Online) Cyber Crime Unit identified that he was responsible for several fraudulent payments into money mule accounts, and that several thousand pounds had also been paid directly into accounts under his control, the Met said.\n\nIn December 2014, a malware virus infected computers and victims around the world, with several victims and companies in Australia being affected.\n\nFrom intelligence received from the banking industry, officers identified several fraudulent payments had been made from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia into UK bank accounts, the Met said.\n\nWorking closely with the banks involved, officers managed to identify a common IP address that was linked to several of the payments made into UK accounts.\n\nFurther enquiries led officers to identify that the IP address was registered to Skowron\u2019s address and he was arrested by detectives on December 9, 2014, the spokesperson said.\n\nDetectives seized computers and phones and from detailed forensic analysis of the devices, they found evidence and messages that confirmed Skowron was involved in arranging fraudulent payments to be made into various \u2018money mule\u2019 accounts.\n\nText messages found on Skowron\u2019s phones - some of which he tried to delete and hide from detectives - revealed that he was working with another man, Piotr Ptach to identify and recruit \u2018money mules\u2019 - individuals whose accounts they could use to transfer proceeds of frauds into, before the funds get moved on again, withdrawn and laundered, police say.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation officers also linked Skowron to two separate cyber attacks against UK construction companies where the companies had fallen victim to \u2018man-in-the-middle\u2019 attacks in April 2014.\n\nEmployees had unwittingly downloaded malware onto their system, which enables cyber criminals and fraudsters to then track online banking login details.\n\nThe criminals then use this information to log into the victim\u2019s bank accounts and make fraudulent balance transfers into accounts owned, or controlled by the criminal network, police say.\n\nIn total, the two companies lost around \u00a3500,000 to the cyber attacks, and officers identified that approximately \u00a339,000 had been transferred into a bank account Skowron had opened himself just nine days before the fraud took place.\n\nAfter further enquiries Skowron was eventually charged in June 2016 with the above offences.\n\nPtach, 31 of no fixed abode was also charged in November 2015 with fraud and money laundering offences, to which he pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court and was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment in March 2016.\n\nDetective constable Jody Stanger, from the Met\u2019s Operation Falcon Cyber Crime Unit, who investigated the case said: \u201cSkowron played a significant part in a wider criminal network that was responsible for several high-value frauds using malware.\n\n\u201cThe proceeds of this fraud were then laundered through an organised money mule network.\n\n\u201cThis conviction and sentence is the culmination of a long and complex investigation and shows that we will relentlessly pursue criminals involved in serious and organised crime online.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live.\n\nHere are four ways you can be sure you\u2019ll be amongst the first to know what\u2019s going on.\n\n1) Make our website your homepage\n\n2) Like our Facebook page\n\n3) Follow us on Twitter\n\n4) Register with us by clicking on \u2018sign in\u2019 (top right corner).

    "text": "FOR some time, I have been trying to tear myself away from driving my taxi at night, in a partially-successful effort to improve the quality of the time I spend outside work.\n\nTaxi driving is not a nine-to-five job, especially since the long years of recession continue to take their toll. It is necessary to work when and where the work is and to spend long hours waiting, in between work, to make anything resembling a living from it.\n\nWorking nights carries with it a sort of innate cynicism, borne of the drunken antics of the travelling public, as well as obvious risks to personal safety. More than this, though, it diminishes the quality of the driver's family and social life, because there is always a financial cost to taking time off work and an imperative to be constantly available.\n\nSunday saw the Abingdon Marathon make its way through the streets of the town and some of the surrounding villages. As an event it has been running for ten years and on Sunday had a rolling programme of road closures, where some of the roads were only closed for 15 minutes.\n\nSuch a difference from the recent Oxford Half Marathon, where the organisers of that event felt it necessary to advertise a five-hour road closure for an entire village as well as some of north Oxford,. hindering the ability of the elderly congregants of at least two churches to get to public worship.\n\nWhile at church on Sunday morning, a tweet came through about road closures for the Abingdon Marathon and thanks to the connections I had made through prolific use of Twitter these last years, it was possible to get good quality advice about the best places to park.\n\nThen I learned the story of number 54, who had travelled from Scotland to take part in the event. Such an activity would be impossible for me, of course, with my present work pattern. The dedication and determination of number 54 is a real inspiration.\n\nSometimes, it is necessary to make a decisive change to routine, otherwise things will just stay the same. Sometimes that change can start with a small act, like parking up the taxi getting out and walking.\n\nDriving in Oxford is stressful, especially through the void of uncertainty which is Frideswide Square.\n\nWalking outside Oxford rail station on Friday morning, I was astonished when a cyclist actually slowed almost to a halt and waved me across the road, giving way to me.\n\nSo much so, that I hesitated and he had to wave me across a second time. \"Thank you, Sir,\" I said loudly, in the classic English manner, to be sure he was aware of my appreciation.\n\nOrdinarily, travelling around Oxford is subject to a sort of battle of wills, between cyclists, motorists and sometimes also pedestrians, but on Friday, the entire day was made better, thanks to a simple early morning act of kindness.",

    "title": "Fixing Serious Injuries: Regenerative Therapy and Your Horse",
    "text": "What is Regenerative Therapy?\n\nRegenerative therapies are part of a relatively new branch of medicine which uses biological material to augment the body\u2019s own restorative capabilities to promote the regrowth of healthy tissue and return the damaged area to normal function. Unlike symptomatic drug treatments that mask pain or reduce inflammation by putting a Band-Aid on a problem, regenerative therapies actually fix the underlying tissue damage.\n\nFor years, the term \u201cregenerative medicine\u201d has been associated with stem cells and stem cell-related therapies. These treatments are invasive and involve the painful harvesting of a horse\u2019s cells from bone marrow, fat or blood (PHP).\n\nLuckily, there is a new regenerative treatment that is taking human medicine by storm: amnion. Amnion is the innermost membrane and surrounding fluid that protects and nurtures a baby as it grows in its mother\u2019s womb. This material, which typically ends up on the ground during birth, is rich in all the basic building blocks of tissue and bone: collagen, growth factors, hyaluronic acid, carbohydrates, and proteins essential for fetal development. By using this \u201cmiracle of birth,\u201d amniotic treatments do not require the painful harvesting or culturing of stem cells the way other regenerative treatments do.\n\nAdditionally, amnion is immune privileged, which is the reason mothers do not reject the \u201cforeign body\u201d growing in them during pregnancy. As a result, the body will not reject amniotic treatments the way it does with other types of tissue transplants. This means unlike any other treatment, patients\u2014either human or horse\u2014can be treated the same day as diagnosis at a better value due to no harvesting or culturing of cells.\n\nHow does amnion work?\n\nAmnion works by creating a \u201cbioscaffold\u201d around the wounded area and helps the body create and heal the wound with the correct, matching material rather than whatever is lying around.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nInjuries in animals are like a tornado ripping a house from its foundation. The injured tissue is scattered around and left structurally damaged or weakened. After the initial shock, the body calls for help by way of inflammation much like the way a home owner would call for help. If the area has good blood flow, the body can typically heal itself. If the area is remote with poor blood flow\u2014legs, joints, etc.\u2014then the body is forced to heal the area with whatever material it has on hand or falls off the truck in the limited blood flow. This leaves the rebuilt wound neither cosmetically appealing or structurally sound and usually results in scar tissue, proud flesh, and susceptible to reinjury. For more on this, please see \u201cWhat do horses and tornados have in common?\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean for my horse?\n\nWound remodeling at the source of injury. Due to its ability to treat chronic, hard-to-heal wounds, amniotic material has a long and varied history of success in humans. Its beneficial uses as a wound and burn treatment can be traced to the early 1900s and its use for eye ulcers in the late 1940s. Historically, storage and collection were difficult, but today, thanks to advancements in cryopreservation technologies, the use of amniotic material experienced a significant resurgence as a treatment for diabetic and other wounds from 2009 onward.\n\nAccording to Mike Ross, DVM, DACVS, in Diagnosis and Management of Lameness in the Horse, 33 percent of barrel racing horses suffer career-ending injuries each year. By using an amnion-based treatment, such as AniCell Biotech\u2019s AniMatrX\u2122, these tendon injuries do not have such devastating consequences.\n\nVets like Mark Haugland, DVM, DACVS are seeing better results on severe tendon and ligament injuries with AniCell Biotech\u2019s AniMatrX\u2122 products.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is my first option for treatment of tendon lesion,\" Haugland said. \"I think clients will pursue amnion, as it is less expensive than stem-cell treatment and can be used immediately without bone marrow or fat harvest. Healing response is faster than PRP. I would recommend the product to others, and it is on my list of go-to treatments for tendon or ligament injuries.\"\n\nWant an example?

    "title": "Samsung Gear S3 review: the best of both worlds",
    "text": "Samsung used IFA 2016 as the stage to present two more smartwatch models, thus expanding its wearables portfolio. The Gear S3 Classic and the Gear S3 Frontier combine the features we already had the pleasure of using on the Gear S2 in 2015, in addition to the more recent fitness tracker functions found on the Gear Fit2. In today\u2019s review, we\u2019ll take a look at what other innovations Samsung has integrated into its latest newcomer. How to set up and customize your smartwatch\n\nGear S2 review\n\nRating\n\nGood \u2713 long battery life\n\n\u2713 simple controls thanks to the bezel\n\n\u2713 well-made\n\n\u2713 water and dust-proof with IP68 certification Bad \u2715 variety of apps limited\n\n\u2715 the bezel rattles slightly\n\nSamsung Gear S3 design and build quality When looking at the design and size of the Gear S3, it\u2019s quite evident that Samsung had a male target group in mind when building the smartwatch. The display grew from 1.2 to 1.3 inches and even the dimensions and the weight have been increased accordingly. In terms of appearance, the Classic model, as its name foretells, has a very classic menswear-type look, while the Frontier has much more sporty chronometer style and includes a rotating navigation bezel. The Frontier has a bezel much like a diving ring. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT The build of both models meets high standards, however there is one drawback: the bezel on both devices doesn\u2019t sit firmly. There seems to be a just a sliver of extra space between the two parts, causing a slight but tangible rattling sound when you tap on the display. That being said, the bezel feels more secure on the newer models than it does on the Gear S2. Which one do you prefer? The Classic (right) or the Frontier? / \u00a9 AndroidPIT Just like the Gear S2 and Gear Fit2, both Gear S3 models have two physical buttons on the right side of the watch. The button on the Classic model reminds me of a digital sports watch. Samsung made the call to have a much flatter surface on the Frontier version, while simultaneously opting for a textured material to allow the user to feel for the button without having to look for it. The top button functions as the usual back button, while the bottom one brings the user back to the home screen. The pulse sensor is found on the back of the device. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT Both Gear S3 models are delivered with the same extras: there\u2019s a wireless charging dock, a power supply with a hard-wired microUSB cable and a short watchband for smaller wrists. The watchband for the Classic is made of leather, while the Frontier comes with a silicone band. Both models are IP68 certified, meaning that they are dust and water-resistant. Samsung has specified that the Gear S3 can be dunked into 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes at a time. The Classic model is elegant and slick. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nSamsung Gear S3 display As previously mentioned, the Gear S3 of 1.3 inches is 0.1 inch larger than its predecessor, the S2. The resolution stays the same at 360 x 360 pixels. A Korean spokesperson also told us that the S3 is antialiased, meaning that any overly pixelated effects or step effect that sometimes happens in the edges of images or dials are smoothed out. The 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display has 360x360 resolution. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT The brightness of the Super AMOLED display is excellent and even in direct sunlight the content on the display is legible. In comparison to the Gear S2, the maximum display brightness on both Gear S3 models is noticeably higher. There is, however, no ambient light sensor on the Gear S3 as there is on the Moto 360, meaning that you often need to manually adjust the brightness. Though the lack of this feature is a shame, you get used to it after a while.\n\nSamsung Gear S3 software Samsung uses their homemade operating system Tizen on both models of the Gear S3, just like they did on the Gear Fit2 and both versions of the Gear S2. Samsung claims that there are now around 10,000 apps available for the smartwatch platform. The Gear S3 also brought some improvements in terms of software, for example, you can now install apps directly from the smartwatch. This will save users having to use the companion app to get apps on their wearable. Apps can be installed directly onto the watch. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT Operating and navigating haven\u2019t changed in that they are accessed via the menus. Thanks to the combination of the touchscreen, the bezel and the physical button, I found that operating the Gear S3 was very easy, as was the Gear S2 before it. Samsung set up Tizen on the Gear S3 so well that you barely need a user manual to figure out how to use it. There is of course the addition of many new sensors in the the latest Tizen version, which allows the smartwatch to collect and calculate a wide range of fitness data. The barometer can even sense height and speed. The GPS module, in combination with the correct app, are able to track distances so that you can use the Gear S3 as an independant navigation device or speed calculator. These functions also have corresponding apps. It\u2019s also worth noting that it's possible to make an emergency call and send your location by just pressing a button. This means that if you are in a state of emergency, you press the lower button three times to call for assistance and your position will be sent as well. Thanks to the microphone and headphones, you can now make and receive calls. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT I was also impressed by the fact that you can connect the Galaxy Gear S3 with Android smartphones produced by other manufacturers. For those who own an iPhone from Apple, you too have the possibility to use a Galaxy Gear S3 with your phone as opposed to the Apple Watch. An iOS app for this purpose was recently leaked and is currently in beta testing in South Korea. If testing proves to be successful, this iOS app will be officially released. While testing the Gear S3, we were also able to download a leaked version of the iOS app and we gave it a try. While the connection between both devices worked without problem, there were still issues with regards to the App Store on the Gear S3. Updates and new apps were difficult to install, and often it was impossible to install apps at all. The Gear S3 will soon be able to be paired with Apple's iPhone. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nSamsung Gear S3 performance As I mentioned a few times already in this review, Samsung has made some small changes to their new smartwatch in comparison to the previous model. This also applies to the hardware running within the smartwatch. It may seem like that Samsung didn\u2019t change anything when you look at the a 1 GHz dual-core processor, however the changes can be found in the details. The processor is now an Exynos and is LTE-compatible. The new processor is now also paired with 769 MB of memory. 4 GB of internal storage are also available for the operating system, apps and audio data. This means that joggers will be able to go out for a run without needing to lug a smartphone around with them. You can use your Bluetooth headphones for listening and the Gear S3 as an MP3 player. You can play music without a smartphone nearby since the Gear S3 has 4 GB of internal storage and speakers. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT At no point did we notice any lags or glitches on the Gear S3 Classic and Gear S3 Frontier. The menus and apps worked smoothly, navigating effortlessly from one screen to another when swiping.\n\nSamsung Gear S3 audio Another new feature is the possibility of making calls thanks to the integration of a microphone and speaker. Whether you would actually ever use this out in the open is questionable though. This could be useful in the comfort of your own home though so that you don\u2019t always have to carry your phone around with you. You can also use the Gear S3 as an MP3 player with the integrated speaker. You might not use this every day though seeing as the sound that comes from the integrated mono speaker is rather lousy. If anything, it could work as a party favor or to entertain children.\n\nSamsung Gear S3 battery Thanks to the larger housing on the Gear S3, Samsung was able to use a larger battery. The Gear S2 had 250 mAh, so both Gear S3\u2019s will last quite a bit longer with 380 mAh. This is 50 percent increase in battery capacity, which is quite impressive. The Gear S3 has improved battery capacity with 380 mAh. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT With the help of its large battery, both the Gear S3 Frontier and Classic with their optimized 1.3-inch Super AMOLED displays, improved processor and numerous additional sensors were able to run for 2.5 days. If you activate the WiFi toggle so that it is constantly on the lookout for a connection, the battery life will drop down to 1.5 days.\n\nSamsung Gear S3 technical specifications\n\nType: Watch Model: Sorry, not yet available! Manufacturer: Samsung Dimensions: 49 x 46 x 12.9 mm Weight: 57 g Battery size: 380 mAh Screen size: 1.3 in Display technology: AMOLED Screen: 360 x 360 pixels (278 ppi) Front camera: Sorry, not yet available! Rear camera: Sorry, not yet available! Flashlight: Sorry, not yet available! RAM: 768 MB Internal storage: 4 GB Removable storage: Not available Chipset: Sorry, not yet available! Number of cores: 2 Max. clock speed: 1 GHz Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.2\n\n\n\nFinal verdict At first glance, both Gear S3 models put on a good show thanks to the combination of its fitness features like on the Gear Fit2 and smartwatch functions as on the Gear S2, wrapped up in one single device. The Gear S3 has allowed Samsung to further expand their portfolio, especially for the male target group. They now have a complete lineup of wearables for a variety of users. The Gear S3 versions, however, did not revolutionize the smartwatch market but they have made some worthwhile improvements. The iOS compatibility just needs to be ironed out, at which point I believe many Apple Watch users will switch to the Gear S3. Is the Gear S3 better than the Gear S2? Technically and functionally-speaking, it only improves over the previous model to a limited extent. I could live without the GPS feature and I prefer the size and weight of the Gear S2, even if that means I need to take it off to recharge every night. What do you think of the Gear S3? Would you consider buying it, and if so, which one?",

    "text": "The \u201cunder control\u201d inflation is usually 3-4%. We can expect the repo rate to come down in the next few months if inflation remains reigned in. (PTI)\n\nIndia\u2019s real estate market has seen a lot of churning of black money in the past. Even economists have been guarded in their opinions while trying to gauge the impact of demonetization on stemming black money. A lot of unaccounted wealth is tied up in real estate. However, the government is aware of this. So it is possible that the next step in curbing black money would be by way of going after real estate investments made through black money.\n\nThe Indian real estate market: A correction is imminent\n\nPost demonetization, many people are wondering if real estate prices are going to drop. There is a finite possibility that prices will moderate in the coming months. \u201cThe reasons are obvious. Black money and corruption in real estate have been disrupted by demonetization. Cash-based transactions that were being done rampantly to save taxes and duties have been impacted. However, not all real estate property will be impacted by demonetization,\u201d says Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar.\n\nThere are broadly two types of residential property\u2014luxury housing and budget housing. The market for luxury housing may take a hit since this is where a great deal of undeclared income is invested. Budget homes, on the other hand, are often purchased by salaried people who pay taxes and whose incomes are declared. In such cases, property prices may not fall dramatically.\n\nThe other way to view the impact would be through the type of builders. Established builders and Tier-1 property developers tend to keep their books clean, rendering the cash component of property purchases minimal to virtually nil. \u201cTherefore, circulation of black money in real estate transactions in case of such builders may be small. This may not be the case, however, with other builders who tend to accept cash towards sale considerations, thus developing the scope for black money circulation,\u201d says Shetty.\n\nApart from demonetization, there is the Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA), which will make the real estate market more buyer-friendly. In the past, buyers were at risk especially from unscrupulous builders and fly-by-night operators. There were cases of delays in delivery, shoddy work, and outright cheating on promised area with confusing terms such as carpet area, built area, and the like. Usually, the agreement was found heavily in favour of the builder. RERA will, however, make property deals more transparent and fair to buyers.\n\nYou May Also Want To Watch:\n\nThe degree of impact\n\nThough this is in the realm of speculation, most experts are of the view that property prices may correct further. This could be even more in case of luxury housing and in the resale market. As per a few reports, the prices of luxury houses have already come down by more than 30% in a few circles in Mumbai and Delhi. This will remain so for the next 2-3 years depending on how fast the economy recovers from the demonetization impact.\n\nIf the much-promised crackdown on real estate happens next year, we can see further drop in prices. However, things will eventually stabilize and honest property buyers will reap the benefits of a cleanup in real estate.\n\nShould you buy now or wait?\n\nEven now, despite the clear intent shown by the Central government on black money, many builders are holding onto old prices. Buyers need not hurry and can afford to wait for a few months. \u201cHaving said that, for serious buyers looking to purchase property in the immediate future, this is probably the best time to go through various options available in their city. They should carefully evaluate options, negotiate a good price with the builder, and shortlist their dream property,\u201d advises Shetty.\n\nThe possible direction of repo rate\n\nDemonetization has brought down inflation. In fact, the inflation number that came in a week ago is the lowest in the last few quarters. Historically, the Reserve Bank of India has been open to lowering the repo rate when inflation is under control. The \u201cunder control\u201d inflation is usually 3-4%. We can expect the repo rate to come down in the next few months if inflation remains reigned in.\n\nThere are, however, some threats to the stability of inflation. The US Federal Reserve System has increased interest rates recently, taking the country out of the near-zero rate that has prevailed since the Great Recession. It has already resulted in capital outflow from emerging markets, including India, to the United States. \u201cIf the government takes a view on this, the RBI will find it difficult to lower the rate. Even if there is a cut in the repo rate, it may not be drastic. There are other pressures on the inflation rate, such as expected increase in the prices of fuel and food,\u201d says Shetty.\n\nRecently, many banks have already reduced their home loan rates by 25 basis points. These rates may go down further by another 25 basis points, but any expectation beyond this would be unrealistic. Hence, buyers should focus more on the fall in real estate prices than on home loan rate drops, and take a call on their property purchase decision.",

    "text": "Amanda Harris and Frenchman Fire Fly won the Silesia, Montana, American Rodeo qualifier October 23, 2016, by nearly two tenths of a second. BHN visited with Amanda about solidifying her first trip to the semifinals for a shot at competing in the world's richest one-day rodeo.\n\nBy Blanche Schaefer\n\nCompeting against the top cowboys and cowgirls in the nation for a slice of a $2 million pie has set the bar high for many rodeo contestants since RFD-TV\u2019s inaugural The American Rodeo in 2014. Each year, hundreds of barrel racers enter various qualifiers across the United States, gunning for their shot at a run under the bright lights of famed AT&T Stadium. In the end, only four will remain. The path to Arlington, Texas, is crowded with the nation\u2019s fastest horses and handiest riders, but the qualification process gives anyone a chance to outrun them. Barrel racers run at designated qualifier races throughout the fall and winter to advance to The American semi-finals in Fort Worth, Texas, from February 15\u201317, 2017, where they will compete against several \u201cexemption\u201d riders invited by The American. A slack round followed by a shootout round determine who advances to AT&T Stadium in Arlington for The American on February 19, 2017. Qualifiers compete in the long round against the top 10 Women\u2019s Professional Rodeo Association barrel racers in the country, who receive an automatic invitation to The American. Out of the long round, only four will advance to the final shootout match to battle for a hefty championship purse: $100,000 if the winner is a rider invited by The American or $1 million to a champion who qualified through the semi-finals. With qualifier season well under way, we spoke to several winners who\u2019ve solidified a spot in The American semi-finals.\n\n\n\nWhat is your background with Frenchman Fire Fly? He was bred and raised by my dad, Bob Welsh. My dad started him on the pattern as a 4-year-old and just eased him along last year to some barrel races. He\u2019s 6 this year, and I picked him up about a year ago. It\u2019s been a whirlwind with him; he\u2019s really been a blessing. I took him to his first rodeo in February at the Black Hills Stock Show, and he pulled a check out there. He consistently got better and better, and he qualified us for the Badlands Circuit Finals this year, so I decided to take the chance at the qualifier in Silesia because it was closest to us, we\u2019ve ran there before and he really likes that pen, so I thought why not.\n\nWhat was your run like? He won by almost a full two-tenths. I ran him the day before, because he\u2019s the type of horse who gets stronger with each run. When I got on him, he was ready to go. He knew there was a lot at stake\u2014he could feel my excitement. He took off pretty far back in the alley, and I knew if I pulled him up it would mess him up. I gave him the reins, and he just really took care of me. Most horses you have to season, but he\u2019s one where it doesn\u2019t matter where he\u2019s at, he\u2019s going to go do his job. He loves it; I never have to worry if he\u2019s going to work or not, he gives me 110 percent every run. My dad did a phenomenal job with him. He\u2019s easy to ride behind, and he definitely made a \"He knew there was a lot at stake\u2014he could feel my excitement.\" -Amanda Harris and Frenchman Fire Fly won the Silesia, Montana, qualifier for The American Rodeo by almost two-tenths Oct. 23, 2016. Photo by Olie's Images.great horse.\n\nDid you have a strategy at the Silesia qualifier? I set a goal to be in the top 10. I\u2019m a pretty competitive person, so I would have liked to win it, but I wanted to be in the top 10 to get on to the semifinals. I told myself I had nothing to lose, to let it all hang out and go after it. I rode him aggressive, and he fired phenomenally, so he was ready to go as much as I was.\n\nHow will you prepare for the semifinals? Until then, I\u2019ll keep him running and keep him firing. I\u2019ll enter some winter rodeos, but I don\u2019t want to change anything that I\u2019ve done. It all came together pretty well, so if it\u2019s working, don\u2019t change it.\n\nWhat does qualifying a homebred horse mean to you and your family? My dad has put a lot of thought process and time into his breeding program, so to compete with that caliber of horses means a lot. Fire Fly is so special to us, and we are pretty fortunate to have a horse like him in our family. He proved to us he can run with the best, and we\u2019re so excited to see where he goes from here. I couldn\u2019t do it without the support of my husband, in-laws, parents, and two sponsors who stick by us and believe in my team of young horses\u2014Simply Eden and Famous Equine.\n\nBlanche Schaefer is associate editor of Barrel Horse News.

    "text": "Across the Land: In the Departure lounge to Damascus\n\nFirst impressions are of a bright, swanky and welcoming new terminal. Photo: Zohaib Sikander\n\nPHUKET: On the 16th of September, Phuket officially opened the much anticipated and delayed new Phuket International terminal. The terminal is expected to accommodate up to 5 million international passengers a year while, the old terminal will accommodate 7.5 million domestic passengers.\n\n\n\nFirsthand experience arriving at the new international terminal two days after the official opening left me a little disappointed.\n\n\n\nFirst impressions are of a bright, swanky and welcoming terminal, but as I approached the queue at the immigration arrival booths, I was flooded with a familiar feeling of disappointment upon seeing the same old long queues \u0096 if not even longer.\n\n\n\nThe wait was a good 40 to 60 minutes, with flights continuing to arrive and queues lengthening by the minute. The arrival lounge in the new terminal has two rows of immigration booths with a capacity of at least 38 booths, but only 12 were functioning.\n\n\n\nThe departure lounge, which has capacity for 34 immigration booths, was reportedly suffering from similarly long queues. Passengers had been warned to arrive at the airport at least an hour earlier than normal in anticipation of the extra time needed to get through.\n\n\n\nCustomer reviews on Skytrax of the new Phuket international terminal highlighted Immigration's departure booths, among others, as \"pure mayhem\", \"absolute carnage\" and \"a very bad experience\". Skytrax is an international air transport rating organization, evaluating and advising on the quality standards at airlines and airports across the world. Given that the terminal had plenty of time to prepare and that the additional computer terminals and immigration officers were essential, having these in place should have been top of the list.\n\n\n\nThe high season is around the corner and the anticipation that Russian tourists will return means increased chartered flights from Russia on top of the normal high-season crowds.\n\n\n\nThe new Phuket terminal needs to take a page or two from Singapore. Skytrax has just announced the world\u2019s top airports for 2015 and for the fourth year in a row, Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport has been voted as the best airport in the world. Seven of the top 10 airports are actually in Asia.\n\n\n\nWe need to add value to all passengers coming or going through the new terminal. The terminal is the start or end to a great and memorable holiday in Phuket. That\u2019s what we want them to remember; not the 40-minute wait to get passports stamped.\n\n\n\nAccording to Airports of Thailand, from January to July there were 8.9 million inbound tourists through Phuket International airport, which is a 19.7 per cent increase from last year. The second half of 2016 will surely be a \u0091real-time\u2019 test for Phuket Airport. For the sake of all businesses in Phuket, we just have to nail it.\n\n\n\nAmy Koh is the sales manager of Engel & Voelkers Phuket.

    "text": "Once you have tallied up about a month\u2019s worth of expenses, divide your expenses into the categories of necessities, sanity savers, and luxuries.\n\nSavings can only be done when you are able to manage your household budget in an efficient way. For this, you have to standardise the savings ratio which means that you need to save at least 10% to 20% of income after meeting your expenses. These savings help you in achieving your financial goals like retirement planning, child education and wedding planning.\n\nCreate a scope for your earnings\n\nWell, to manage your financial budget, firstly you need to earn. That can include daily incentives. Whenever you are getting remuneration, just encash it. Apart from this, try to make an area for your \u2018monthly income\u2019. This is what you take home after taxes are taken out, if applicable. Typically housewives can generate a lump sum amount of money from their kitty. The amount generated from kitties are interest-free savings they do over a period of the cycle. Eventually, they are paid all the accumulated lump sum amount which becomes very beneficial at the time of buying exorbitant things.\n\nCalculate your Expenses (Fixed, Flexible & Discretionary)\n\nHow much per week do you spend on transportation? What is the usual amount that you spend on groceries, or how many times per week do you go for an outing? How many times you go out for dining? Think of other essential things that you need, not want. You can save a good amount of money from your discretionary expenses. Apart from the discretionary expenses, pen down all your fixed & flexible expenses too which are needed on daily basis.\n\nSegregate your expenses and protect them from losses\n\nOnce you have tallied up about a month\u2019s worth of expenses, divide your expenses into the categories of necessities, sanity savers, and luxuries. You need to have a health insurance which will control heavy expenses which can occur at the time of medical emergency. Moreover, you must have a term insurance because it forms an umbrella of protection over your family and your financial liabilities.\n\nStart organising your debts\n\nAre there any monthly or yearly bills that you need to pay? There are many expenses which do not occur on daily or weekly basis but occur on yearly basis. For example, while taking an insurance plan you need to pay a premium which is paid annually or semi-annually. Some other examples would be car payments, rent or mortgage, utilities (such as water, electricity, etc.), and taxes (income, house, etc.)\n\nWork out on your Emergency Fund\n\nAt times it happens when your weekly cash boundary goes slightly over your weekly spending limit, which may affect your hip pocket and can end up going on the extra charge on your credit card. By fusing some extra saving, approximately 5% of your expenses, you may be able to meet any kind of unexpected medical payments, car or house maintenance costs or any of the other exigencies. If nothing falls over your cash limit, you will end up with surplus saving which can be again used for a certain financial goal at the end by meeting the requirement through this wealth creation.\n\nYou may also view:\n\nAnalyse your financial goals with respect to time horizon\n\nYour savings need to be invested in the right direction so that you can achieve your future financial goals of life. Do you need to plan for your children\u2019s education? Do you need to replace any household items this year? Do you want to buy a car? Plan for this in advance and you won\u2019t need to draw on your long-term savings. Another important point to note is that you should aim to only buy these items after you have saved for them. Ask yourself, have you started saving for financial goals now?\n\nMake up a new budget, assimilating your expenses and financial goals\n\nAlways try to do spending on the necessities only. Cut out on the luxury items and save the sanity savers for those times you are really pulling your hair out. Try to stick to your new budget. Eventually, your amount for sanity savers will get lessen, and the fact that you have previously estimated for them means they can go into extra savings when you actually don\u2019t need them. The healthier the budget the healthier you will be and the healthier your money will grow.\n\nReview your budget on time\n\nAll your planning needs to be reviewed so that your daily action plan does not go beyond your cash limit. From your basic to luxury needs, everything should reflect on your household budget so that you can easily achieve all your financial goals without perturbing your day to day expenses. If are able to regularise your budget today, you can plan for a better tomorrow.",

    "text": "The OnePlus 3 is one of the best smartphones of 2016, but OnePlus has already decided to raise the bar even higher. They wanted to offer users the best possible experience, so they\u2019re now offering even better hardware with the new OnePlus 3T. Check out our review of OnePlus\u2019 latest and greatest to find out if it really beats its predecessor. OnePlus 3 review: going mainstream\n\nOnePlus 3 discontinued in US and Europe\n\nRating\n\nGood \u2713 Good camera\n\n\u2713 Fluid, customizable interface\n\n\u2713 Quick \"Dash Charge\" system\n\n\u2713 High performance Bad \u2715 No design update since the OnePlus 3\n\n\u2715 No microSD slot\n\n\u2715 Only Full-HD (1920x1080) Screen Resolution\n\n\u2715 No Android Nougat yet\n\nOnePlus 3T design and build quality My colleague Omar raved about the design of the OnePlus 3 during his test of the device. I find myself in the same situation with the OnePlus 3T today, with one key difference: the OnePlus 3 was the rightful heir to the OnePlus 2, while the OnePlus 3T is just a little brother to the OnePlus 3. If you liked the design of the OnePlus 3, you'll like the OnePlus 3T. The design is basically the same. OnePlus kept the aluminum unibody, the elegant curved edges, the fingerprint scanner on the front, the sound setting Hotkeys...all the things which made us fall in love with the OnePlus 3. It's not particularly helpful to review all of these features, so I will just share the ones which really make the phone's strengths stand out. The fingerprint scanner is located under the screen. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT OnePlus knows how to make use of space on their phones. Unlike Google, which puts an empty space under the screen of its Pixel phones, OnePlus takes advantage of the space to house its fingerprint reader. Above, we find the speaker and sensors. On the right side, we find the button to turn the display off and on, and trays for two nano SIM cards. Apart from the new Gunmetal color, the 3T looks the same as a OnePlus 3. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT If there's one thing I find handy on an iPhone, it's the ability to switch from ringtone to silent mode with the easily distinguishable side buttons. OnePlus gave the 3T a similar setup, giving the ability to switch to silent mode without having to turn on the screen. Another advantage is the USB (2.0) Type-C port found on the bottom of the device, between the speaker and the mini-jack (yes, there is a mini-jack!). Having the mini-jack port on the bottom of the device isn't necessarily bad; it just means you have to put your phone in your pocket upside down when you listen to music, so it's right-side-up and ready to use when you take it out that way. Unfortunately, the camera protrudes a little bit from the back of the phone. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT With regard to handling, it is a treat. Of course, you must love screens which are a little bit big, and in certain circumstances it is necessary to use two hands. This device is subjectively large, with the following dimensions: 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm. That being said, it's certainly not too big, as you don't have to worry about it having difficulty sliding into your pocket. If you want a phone with a premium look and feel, you will be well-served by the OnePlus 3T. The surface and build quality of the 3T is consistent with other metal body phones like the Google Pixel, giving it a truly chic appearance. Of the two colors, Soft Gold and Gunmetal, I really like the Gunmetal which recalls the lighter gray shade of the original OnePlus 3.\n\nOnePlus 3T display Once again, OnePlus opted for a 5.5-inch display. This is something that was successful on its predecessor, the OnePlus 3. The screen is an Optic AMOLED, which according to OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, is tweaked specifically for the handset, making contrast and color temperature truer to life and viewing better when outdoors. The OnePlus 3T comes with a Full-HD screen and this choice has advantages and disadvantages. One the one hand, the energy consumption is not too high, particularly with the AMOLED screen. But the downside is that the definition is not ideal for VR. You can adjust the display settings yourself. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT The screen is 5.5 inches, making it one of the smaller phablets. Like that of the OnePlus 3, the pixel density is 401 ppi. The screen is Full-HD (1920x1080), which at the advent of VR, is unfortunate. Some newer phones have Quad-HD (2560x1440) resolution instead. Nevertheless, the screen is quite good, the colors are vivid, and I have no problems with it. You can adjust the display settings yourself by calibrating the screen, setting the color temperature differently or by using the sRGB mode. It is pleasant to use this mode, since it makes it less tiring for the eyes, but the yellow hue may get on your nerves. Unfortunately, I lack the special equipment to test the screen brightness objectively, but it seems to be pretty good. White on the screen sometimes tends toward yellow or blue hues depending on the angle you hold the device. I couldn't test it in strong sunlight, since the sun isn't strong in Berlin this time of year. The 3T's night mode adapts the colors of the screen so your eyes don't get tired when reading in low light conditions. This is one of the more interesting features of the device for me. By default, the Gorilla Glass 4 screen comes with a 2.5D screen protector. The protector comes pre-installed since Gorilla Glass 4 is more easily scratched than Gorilla Glass 3.\n\nOnePlus 3T software Here is where I was really disappointed. On the 3T we find OxygenOS 3.5.1, which is based on...Android 6.0.1! Android Nougat was officially released months ago, and new phones are already being sold running the new version of the OS, but OnePlus opted for the tried and true Marshmallow version anyway. That being said, they already announced that the 3 and 3T would be able to update to Nougat in December. No Nougat, just good old Marshmallow. Do you prefer the light or dark theme? / \u00a9 AndroidPIT In short, the user interface is a lot like stock Android and it isn't built upon the latest version of Android, which is a shame. That said, like with the OnePlus 3, the picture isn't totally black. Some of the the interface elements have changed, like the quick bar settings which look more like Nougat, and the more intuitive options, in addition to a weather app and voice recorder which also appeared. On one hand, devotees of pure Android will find it agreeable, despite some tiny differences like smaller icons here and there. On the other hand, there is no bloatware. The software provides some useful functions, like accessibility help for the visually impaired (TalkBack, different font sizes, zoom gestures) and the App Locker function which locks certain apps with a code through the \"Never Settle\" banner on the top left of the home screen. The menu provides quick access to contacts, apps, and widgets. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT This mode allows you to quickly access your recent contacts, apps, and a status panel which gives you an idea of your remaining battery life, memory usage, and other widgets. Personally, I don't find this very useful, since I prefer to use Google Now to get weather and news updates, but I'm sure some will like it. If you want to customize your menus, you have two options: light or dark. Plus, you can set a secondary color, like an all black menu with green text that will really stand out. More black on an AMOLED is always good for battery life. It's not necessarily useful, but some will like having the color options.\n\nOnePlus 3T performance Before we get too far, let's talk about the technical specs of this device. The processor is a 2.35 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. According to Qualcomm, it's 10 percent more powerful than its predecessor, the 820 with its 2.2 GHz. To complement this, we find the improved Adreno 530 graphics chip, which also boasts at least a 5 percent performance boost and low battery consumption. Along with all of this, we find 6 GB of RAM, plus 64 GB or 128 GB of storage, the latter of which is only available in the Gunmetal color. This device does great on benchmark tests. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT On the 3T, we find UFS 2.0 (universal flash storage), which should allow for relatively quick loading of apps. In practice, I've found this to be true. For everyday use, the performance is good: the RAM and processor can handle multitasking and deliver a good experience consistently. I haven't encountered any crashes, slow downs, or bugs. Everything seems to be fluid. The phone seems to get warm after heavy use, but nothing abnormal. The fingerprint reader can unlock the device and take you to the home screen in 0.2 seconds. You can use both nano SIM trays on the device, but OnePlus unfortunately didn't give us a MicroSD card slot. A feature which will please many is the dual SIM. You can use both nano SIM trays on the device, but OnePlus unfortunately didn't give us a MicroSD card slot. The North American model sports WCDMA: Bands 1/2/4/5/8, FDD-LTE: Bands 1/2/4/5/7/8/12/17/30, and CDMA EVDO: BC0. The OnePlus 3 has a relatively low SAR. As far as benchmarks go, the smartphone scores well, even against the OnePlus 3 which sets the bar. You can find the results of the test in the table below. The battery life test was carried out with the screen at maximum brightness, a topic which we will return to in the section on the battery. Benchmarks - OnePlus 3T 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.1 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 2.0 Geekbench 4 - single core Geekbench 4 - multicore PC Mark Work Performance 2.0 PC Mark Storage PC Mark Battery Google Octane 2.0 OnePlus 3T 2358 2983 30610 1884 4394 5759 4688 4h 54m 6566 OnePlus 3 2291 2862 27038 1715 3972 5355 3646 4h 52m 8115 If you're a VR aficionado, I have bad news. I am very pessimistic about this phone's VR potential due to the low resolution of the screen. The OnePlus 3T has slightly elevated SAR levels from the OnePlus 3, with the highest reported levels being 0.995W/kg (head) and 0.645W/kg (body).\n\nOnePlus 3T audio Here again, we find a single speaker located on the bottom of the phone, on the left side of the USB port, With regard to sound quality, the mono speaker isn't as good as a stereo speaker you could buy in a store, but the quality is satisfactory for what it is. The max volume is pretty high, but at high volumes, quality is degraded and sounds metallic. The mono speaker for listening to music. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT Unfortunately, the phone doesn't come with headphones. Most manufacturers offer headphones, even if they're not the best quality ones. As you can imagine, the audio experience is better with headphones. During calls, I haven't experienced any problems. I could hear and be heard clearly with no concerns about audio quality.\n\nOnePlus 3T camera On the back of the OnePlus 3T, we find the same configuration as that of the OnePlus 3: a Sony IMX 298 16 MP (back) lens with an f/2.0 aperture, and a pixel size of 1.12 microns. That said, the potential is different. Our expert photographer, Robert, has examined the issue and found some differences between the old model and the new one. The most notable difference is the edge-to-edge sharpness of the OnePlus 3T. Lens quality is often prioritized for maximum sharpness in the center of the image area, since most people will ideally photograph their subjects in that space. The areas around the edge can often be softer due to manufacturing or other implementation issues in a lens. However, the OnePlus 3T is sharper edge-to-edge compared to it's predecessor. This will be most apparent in good shooting conditions, like on a bright sunny day, which is when shutter speeds are fast enough to not diminish image quality with blur. The camera on the 3T is perhaps not the best on the market, but it does the job quickly with phase detection auto-focus (0.2 seconds) and generally provides good results. Its photos are good quality, even when conditions aren't very bright. Details show up well and there are no saturation issues. That said, if you zoom in a lot, you will see a sort of border or outline between black and white shapes (like branches and the sky). The green leaves show up very well. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT On the front, we have another 16 MP camera, but it is not the same as the back one: it is a Samsung 3P8SP. The aperture is f/2.0. The quality is good, more than good enough for selfies. The front camera can also take videos in 1080p at 30 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 720p, and 4K. You can see the difference in quality between the OnePlus 3 and the 3T: the colors are better and the details are crisper. The image stabilization is equally good, both optically and electronically. The camera app is the same as the OnePlus 3, both in terms of the interface and its options. Save Location, Shutter Sound, and Save RAW Image are the only possible settings, but rest assured that you will find the manual mode, panorama mode, and the video options, including slow motion and accelerated. The slow motion videos can be shot in 720p. And you can also save your photos in .RAW format. The regular and manual camera mode interfaces are both simple. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT Hint: you can launch the camera app with a double-tap on the camera button, just like the OnePlus 3. It is a shame that there weren't any revolutionary changes to the rear camera, given that the competition doesn't hesitate to up their game with a f/1.7 aperture. For example, Samsung increases their potential during low light conditions and improved the Bokeh effect. View all pictures taken with the OnePlus 3T\n\nOnePlus 3T battery The OnePlus 3 has a batter capacity of 3000 mAh, but it decided to go a step beyond with the OnePlus 3T by offering 3,400 mAh. A larger battery in the same size device, without making design concessions, is very interesting. In general, the battery life is good, but I must admit that I didn't use it too heavily: just instant messaging, news, a bit of video, some music...In short, a user like me will have the phone lasting a day and a half easily. I made time to test it in the shoes of a demanding user, and spent time on it watching videos and playing games, and the phone doesn't disappoint. Overall, it is longer lasting than its predecessor. The Dash Charge system (5 volts 4 amps) allows for quick charging of the phone. The technology provides a stronger current while maintaining a low voltage, which can transfer energy and files quickly. Specifically, I charged the battery from 9 percent to 100 percent in about 75 minutes. OnePlus has indicated that the system provides a whole day's worth of battery life in just 30 minutes of charging time. In practice, I went from 5 percent to 57 percent in half an hour, with WiFi and mobile data turned on. A heavy user would likely not last a whole day with just 57 percent, realistically. I went from 5 percent to 57 percent in half an hour. We hear that fast charging is extraordinary because it avoids heating up the device, and the user may therefore continue to use their phone while charging without any danger. This is maybe true, but we can't assume everything will be cool. The charger itself will heat up as well, and after a while, the phone starts to heat up too. Admittedly the situation is under control, at least according to OnePlus, but a hot charger would panic anyone. With the PCMark 2.0 benchmark, the phone got a 4h 54m score with maximum brightness and the WiFi turned on. In comparison, the OnePlus 3 got 4h 52m with the same conditions (WiFi on, max brightness, and no SIM card).\n\nOnePlus 3T technical specifications\n\nType: Phone Model: OnePlus 3T Manufacturer: OnePlus Dimensions: 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm Weight: 158 g Battery size: 3400 mAh Screen size: 5.5 in Display technology: AMOLED Screen: 1920 x 1080 pixels (401 ppi) Front camera: 16 megapixels Rear camera: 16 megapixels Flashlight: LED Android version: 6.0.1 - Marshmallow User interface: Oxygen OS RAM: 6 GB Internal storage: 128 GB\n\n64 GB Removable storage: Not available Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Number of cores: 4 Max. clock speed: 2.35 GHz Connectivity: LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.2\n\n\n\nFinal verdict The OnePlus 3T is the flagship killer. The OnePlus 3's crown is being taken by the 3T. What was best about the OnePlus 3 is now made even better by the 3T: an upgraded Snapdragon 821 processor, a larger battery, an improved front camera and various software adjustments. In short, the OnePlus 3T does a great impression of a OnePlus 3 version 2.0. That said, if you've already got a OnePlus 3, don't bother to upgrade. The lack of Android Nougat is a mistake on the part of OnePlus, in my opinion. True, the update will be available in December, but a phone with these specs running last year's version of Android just isn't right. The lack of a microSD card slot is also regrettable, but that's not a surprise, since the OnePlus 3 didn't have it either. In the end, the OnePlus 3 is no longer available and this will motivate people to buy the OnePlus 3T, which is more expensive but also more interesting than the OnePlus3. However, I wonder if it would have been easier to simply wait for the OnePlus 4. Could it be that the young Chinese manufacturer will hold us off with the OnePlus 3T, as a signal that it may be a long while before we get the OnePlus 4? Stay tuned.",

Please regularly check https://t.co/Oj8QO8BoiL for the latest pic.twitter.com/jKdzGcjrOi \u2014 Southern (@SouthernRailUK) December 22, 2016\n\nMembers of Aslef are banning overtime, which has led to delays and cancellations to services, causing more misery for the operator\u2019s 300,000 passengers.\n\nThe Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) is also embroiled in a long-running dispute over changing the role of conductors to on-board supervisors (OBS).\n\nWhy ASLEF is taking strike action on Southern Rail https://t.co/QzoXLA3ovu pic.twitter.com/TzkfksnK2b \u2014 ASLEF (@ASLEFunion) December 16, 2016\n\nCharles Horton, chief executive of Southern\u2019s owners Govia Thameslink Railway, said in the letter that the company wanted to press ahead with extending driver-only operation (DOO), which Aslef is opposed to.\n\n\u201cHowever, following the concordat between Aslef and the RMT in November 2015, it is clear to us that we will never be able to secure agreement from Aslef to extend DOO services, despite repeated attempts. The situation is therefore very difficult and it is why we have reluctantly taken the recent course of action.\n\n\u201cI can assure you the decision to extend DOO was not taken lightly or casually. GTR believes there are real benefits to our passengers by refocusing our conductors on customer service and revenue management, through the new OBS role. It is a really important role that we know our passengers value.\u201d\n\nPassengers queue for trains to Gatwick Airport.\n\nMr Horton said the company had offered not to extend DOO beyond existing plans on the GTR network for five years, without the agreement of Aslef.\n\nHe called on drivers to \u201cencourage\u201d Aslef to engage constructively with the company, adding that GTR will not halt its plans, or roll back what has already happened.\n\nAslef leader Mick Whelan responded: \u201cThis letter does nothing to address the substantive issues - and our serious concerns about passenger safety - but merely restates the company\u2019s entrenched position.\n\nMick Whelan\n\n\u201cSouthern is saying this morning what it said last week at Acas and has been saying for the last seven months \u2013 that it is determined to forge ahead with a different system of working which it knows is inherently unsafe, because it cares more about profit than it does about the safety of passengers.\n\n\u201cIt is also interesting to note that the moment we have private, offline, talks in a bid to resolve this situation the company, in bad faith, does this.\u201d\n\nIt is understood the two sides held informal talks on Wednesday.\n\nA GTR spokesman said: \u201cThis franchise is about modernisation of our railway, our trains and services for passengers\u2019 benefit. Despite the unions\u2019 disputes, we\u2019ve never wavered from moving forward with our plans and refocusing conductors on customer service and revenue management through the new OBS role is a core part of our development.\u201d\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan published figures showing that over the last five weeks, only 62% of GTR trains arrived on time, the worst performance for any train operator in more than a decade.\n\nThe figure for Southern was 56%.\n\nSadiq Khan\n\nSadiq Khan said: \u201cThese new figures are the most damning evidence yet that Govia Thameslink are not fit to run rail services around London. The Government and Govia should be utterly ashamed at how many passengers are being let down day after day, and it\u2019s having a detrimental impact on London\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThe trade unions should call off further planned strike action now and get back around the negotiating table, but these figures clearly show how the woeful failings on Southern Rail are symptomatic of much wider problems with the franchise.\n\n\u201cMy message to passengers across the commuter belt is clear: I have a top team at TfL ready to send in at a moment\u2019s notice to sort out Southern and a clear long-term solution of giving control of commuter rail services to TfL, leading to a more reliable, frequent and affordable service.",

    "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Go update: latest news and features",
    "text": "Pok\u00e9mon Go became a mammoth success virtually from day one. Niantic's blockbuster mobile game creates a mirror of the real world using augmented reality, assisted with smartphones\u2019 cameras and GPS chips. This allows players to find, catch and train Pok\u00e9mon (or Pok\u00e9men) in their own neighborhoods. The latest news is that there will be special holiday items coming to the game.\n\nNiantic has delivered on their promise and released the update fans have been waiting for. However, it isn't the 100 new Pok\u00e9mon we had all been expecting: they've only added seven. These seven are from the second generation. For example, there is a baby Pikachu (called Pichu) and an Elekid (a tiny Electabuzz). Once you find the eggs, you can get them to hatch by walking around. Some hatch from walking a distance of 2km, 5km and 10km (the longer the distance, the better the Pok\u00e9mon).\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go has been recently released in India. Indian Pok\u00e9mon fans can now download the app and catch Pok\u00e9mon wherever they are. If you're new to the game, be sure to check out our Pok\u00e9mon Go tips and tricks .\n\nIn addition to solving a mystery vibration issue in the app, Niantic's latest software update APK files include code (which is not yet live) for special \"Holiday Items\" in the shop. The news comes to us via Slashgear , and they say there are six types of boxes in different tiers, all of the same size ratio: bronze, silver, gold, special, great and ultra. The holiday gifts haven't been announced yet, but we suspect an event announcement soon. Perhaps one gift will be made available each day leading up to the new year.\n\nHere are all seven which have been added:\n\nMagby (baby Magmar)\n\nElekid, (baby Electabuzz)\n\nCleffa (baby Clefairy)\n\nIgglypuff (baby Jigglypuff)\n\nPichu (baby Pikachu)\n\nSmoochum (baby Jynx)\n\nTyrogue\n\nThese seven are the first of more we can expect over the next few months, according to Niantic.\n\nNiantic is improving your experience with finding Pok\u00e9mon out there in the augmented reality world. The 'Nearby Pok\u00e9mon' feature is now expanding to more locations so you have more options for catching your pok\u00e9mon. The 'Nearby Pok\u00e9mon' feature has also been enhanced for situations where there aren't enough Pok\u00e9Stops in range. Niantic is testing the update and will make changes as necessary.\n\nFrom December 8, many Starbucks stores across the US will become a PokeStop or gym, according to leaked screenshots posted on Reddit. The leaker says that a Frappuccino icon will appear in the game near stores, allowing players to order a special off-menu drink. If you do, rumors suggest you'll then be gift a currently unreleased Pokemon, which fits with suggestions that there are more than 100 new creatures on the way from last month.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go update: Ditto is finally here!\n\nSince Pok\u00e9mon Go was released, one of the best characters was missing: Ditto. The little purple blob takes the form of whatever other Pok\u00e9mon he's battling, so we suspect writing the code for him was difficult for the developers, which is why the wait has been so long. You won't see him on the map, though. He appears as another Pok\u00e9mon, but reveals himself after being caught. Check out the video in this tweet to see what I mean.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go update adds safety features\n\nOctober 20: Responding to concerns over safety, Niantic is adding enhanced safety features to the next Pok\u00e9mon Go update. The biggest concern over this augmented reality game is driving while playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. Soon you will no longer be able to play Pok\u00e9mon Go while in any vehicle.\n\nAn easy fix is being implemented to prevent anyone driving or riding in a vehicle to play Go while going faster than 30 MPH. Once you've exceeded this speed, Pok\u00e9mon cease spawning in your area and egg distance is no longer counted. This will certainly make it more difficult to play the game but it is after all just a game and shouldn't take precedence over safety.\n\nThe next update is not yet live but we'll let you know as soon as it goes up. Until then, you can always check the official Pok\u00e9mon Go update website or the Niantic Facebook account for the latest.\n\nOctober 11: The next Pok\u00e9mon Go update should have some interesting options for training your Pok\u00e9mon. According to the official Pok\u00e9mon Go Facebook account, update 0.41.2 will allow trainers to bring six Pok\u00e9mon to battle at gyms. You will also be able to adjust your CP of the Pok\u00e9mon you're training in the gym.\n\nOther than a few minor fixes and updates, there is one more particularly interesting tidbit coming soon. As was reported by AndroidPIT on October 6, the new update will include a 'catch bonus' that includes a tier system for types of Pok\u00e9mon. Once you've improved at catching one type of Pok\u00e9mon you will have a better chance of catching this type in the future.\n\nOctober 6: A preview of the next Pok\u00e9mon Go update appeared on the official Niantic website. A new feature is in the works that gives you a 'catch bonus' for when you pick up certain types of Pok\u00e9mon such as Kindler, Psychic, Gardner and more.\n\nWhen you catch Pok\u00e9mon you'll increase your tier for that type of Pok\u00e9mon through a new medal system. The medals better your chances of \"capturing Pok\u00e9mon with a related type\". So if you get a Kindler Medal your chances of catching fire-type Pok\u00e9mon increases.\n\nSeptember 23: The newest Pok\u00e9mon Go update is set to include some changes that will keep you on the hunt. This was announced via Facebook by Niantic and the update is version 0.39.0. The update brings some minor bug fixes but also a couple of cool new features.\n\nThe first feature announced is 'Capture location' where the location of where you caught your Pok\u00e9mon is going to be displayed on the information screen. Also included in the update is wearable compatibility. Niantic will allow trainers to catch their Pok\u00e9mon with the Pok\u00e9mon GO Plus and Incense accessories.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go update includes 'buddy' feature, or not\n\nSeptember 11: This Pok\u00e9mon Go update included a sweet feature: Buddy Pok\u00e9mon. This allow you to choose a Pok\u00e9mon to be, you guessed it, your buddy. This meant that players can earn candy for these buddies by walking certain distances.\n\nOther updates included a tweak that makes it easier to select smaller Pok\u00e9mon on displays, the fix to an issue where eggs would sporadically hatch without an animation, along with better reliability when you switch networks (avoiding 'hang').\n\nAlso worthy of mention is support for Pok\u00e9mon Go Plus, the nifty new way to play this game without even using your phone. And let's not leave out the last little update \u2013 and always my personal favorite whenever Niantic publishes its release notes \u2013 some new minor text fixes.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go update reinstates battery saver mode\n\nAugust 8, 2016: After only a little more than a week, a new Pok\u00e9mon Go update already arrived. Users of the Android app can upgrade to version 0.33.0, while iPhone owners can get iOS version 1.3.0. So what's new this time around? Well, it's not quite the feature dump that the last version was, but there are some good tweaks to know about here.\n\nThe main addition you should know about is, unfortunately, an iOS-only update. Battery saver mode, which was reportedly buggy for many players, has made a return in this new update. The more significant update to the Android app is the for you to change nicknames once. Yes, once only. This mightn't be a big deal to you if your preferred name was available from day one, but for those of us with embarrassing names, this is the time to switch.\n\nOther improvements in this update include XP bonus corrections, plus a player safety warning for those who might be traveling in a vehicle. Stay tuned for the next update \u2013 we've got you covered.\n\nJust another day at AndroidPIT... / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nLatest Pok\u00e9mon Go update is huge\n\nJuly 30, 2016: A significant Pok\u00e9mon Go update has been released after what seemed like forever. Now at build number 0.31.0, the comprehensive changelog provides deeper refinements than last update's simple 'minor text fixes'. Changes include an improved battle system, better Gym animations and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 more minor text fixes. The iOS update is now at version number 1.1.1. Here are some details on the latest happenings in the Pok\u00e9mon Go universe.\n\nPlayer progress resets to Level 1\n\nThere was initial alarm after this update was released, with some players reporting that their progress was reset to Level 1. It's not clear whether the update caused this, but Niantic wrote on its website that this problem is caused when players have two accounts (i.e. one Google and another with the Pok\u00e9mon Trainer Club) and switch between them. If you switch, so does your progress.\n\nProceeding to catch all the Pok\u00e9mon. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nNo more Pok\u00e9mon footprints\n\nNiantic's fix for the imperfect footprint tracking system was a simple one \u2013 dump it. The latest build now contains only a list of nearby Pok\u00e9mon, sans footprints. This makes the list easier to view and will perhaps prevent you from walking in circles when you think a Pok\u00e9mon is close. The old system was definitely inaccurate, so it's unlikely anyone will miss it.\n\nHere are some of the more interesting new features. Let us know what you think of them:\n\nAvatars can be re-customized from the Trainer profile screen\n\nAdjusted battle move damage values for some Pok\u00e9mon\n\nImproved memory issues\n\nModified battle damage calculation\n\nVarious bug fixes during a wild Pok\u00e9mon encounter\n\nUpdated achievement medal images\n\nFixed the issues with displaying certain map features\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go update brings 'minor text fixes'\n\nJuly 20, 2016: This update to Pok\u00e9mon Go seemed a long time coming, but in reality is very minimal. Released only a couple of days ago, the Play Store release notes for version 0.29.3 contain only, \u201cminor text fixes\u201d. The iPhone got an update via version 1.0.3 in Apple\u2019s App Store. Perhaps the update was rushed out, as Niantic didn\u2019t give any details for what the fixes were and, ironically, the release notes themselves don\u2019t even contain correct grammar.\n\nWhen you find out that the new #PokemonGO update is just \"text fixes\" and not the 3 step glitch pic.twitter.com/HJ7w71KTFD \u2014 Michele (@Mishii86) July 20, 2016\n\nApart from not addressing frozen Pokeballs or three-footstep bugs, this update also crashed servers, as was reported on Twitter and other websites. While a small update is better than none, it\u2019s obvious that Pok\u00e9mon Go is buggy and needs a polish. We\u2019ll update you when it gets one.\n\nGotta catch all the updates! / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go launches, world goes crazy\n\nJuly 6, 2016: The first stable version available to Android users was 0.29.0. This was only available in the US, Australia and New Zealand on launch day, which was July 6, 2016. Even though it wasn\u2019t available elsewhere from the Play Store, millions of fans across the globe downloaded the Pok\u00e9mon Go APK from sites like apkmirror.com.\n\nThe game was definitely buggy on launch day, but the huge hype surrounding what had been for many people an unknown type of gaming experience meant that little attention was paid to the software\u2019s flaws. But we waited for an update to arrive and, soon enough, one arrived.",

(Reuters)\n\nThe Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee (MKHC), a conglomerate of leaders of 14 major churches in Mizoram, today appealed to the state government not to observe \u2018Good Governance Day\u2019 on Christmas. The Centre\u2019s decision to observe \u2018Good Governance Day\u2019 on December 25 is one of the most important religious day of Christians, according to a statement issued by the committee.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely unfortunate that the Centre declared December 25 as \u2018Good Governance Day\u2019 which will surely inconvenience many people and disturb Christmas day celebrations,\u201d it said.\n\nYou may also like to watch:\n\nThe MKHC has understood that December 25 is declared as \u2018Good Governance Day\u2019 as it coincides with the birthday of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the statement said, adding it is a sacred day for the Christians.\n\nIt also appealed the state government to appoint another day as Good Governance Day and not organise any official function that could disturb the Christmas day celebrations.\n\nThe MKHC had also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make alternative arrangements so that the sentiment of the Christian community in the region is not hurt, it said.",

    "text": "What Do We Do With Youth Who Attempt To Kill?\n\nThis appeared on SLOG yesterday in Ana Sofia's anti-new-juvie fact check...\n\nThe protesters are asking for the city and county to move towards zero youth detention, a system in which kids are not locked up for committing crimes.\n\nAnd this appeared in Morning News today...\n\nThree Charged in Shooting of Mount Vernon Police Officer: A 44-year-old man and two teenagers have been charged in connection to the shootings, KING 5 reports.\n\nHere are the charging documents from Mount Vernon\u2014where there were two shootings, not one.\n\nErnesto Rivas, the 44-year-old man, is charged with allegedly shooting a Mount Vernon cop in the head. Austin Gonzalez, one of the two teenagers arrested with Rivas, wasn't charged in connection to that shooting. Gonzalez wasn't standing next to Rivas when he allegedly shot the cop, or just hanging out in Rivas's house during the alleged shooting; this isn't a case of bringing identical charges against someone for the crime of standing next to someone committing a crime. No, Gonzalez was charged with an earlier alleged shooting, the incident that brought the cops to Rivas's house in the fist place; the authorities believe Gonzalez, who was born in 2000, was the shooter in that incident. So, again, two people were shot that day in front of Rivas's house, not one: the cop Rivas is alleged to have shot in the head, and the man Gonzalez is alleged to have shot in the neck after the man's car broke down in front of Rivas's house.\n\nAnother round of allegedly's for everybody, the presumption of innocence, no one has been proven guilty of anything, we've yet to hear from the lawyers of the accused, etc. But if Gonzalez is found guilty\u2014if he committed the first of two attempted murders that day\u2014where is this kid supposed to go? If we're not going to lock kids up for committing crimes... then what are we going to do with kids commit murder or attempt to commit murder? Or kids who commit rape?\n\nThere are answers\u2014maybekindasorta\u2014right here on SLOG...\n\nThe detention of our youth is not an inevitable, necessary evil. Contrary to what is often assumed, what frequently distinguishes the youth who sit in detention for weeks or months from the youth who are released back to their families and communities is not the severity of the crime, but the resources of their families and their access to the healthcare and community programs that keep them safe and supported. All youth, even those charged with violent crimes, need appropriate and specialized support and interventions as detention will not address the root cause of why these young people are acting or responding with violence. We encourage the county to be guided by the research that demonstrates how youth detention isolates children when they most need support. We urge the county to invest in family\u2014and community\u2014driven solutions. We support change and innovation in our legal system and an end to systemic racism in our justice system. Together we can create a community that prioritizes and invests in restorative, individualized, and developmentally appropriate strategies to respond to youth behavior and eliminate the need for the continued detention of youth.\n\nI agree with everything in that guest editorial, which was written by a large group of lawyers and advocates for incarcerated youth, and published on SLOG earlier this year. Address the root causes, invest in families and communities, end systemic racism in our justice system (and every other system), prioritize the living shit out of \"restorative, individualized, and developmentally appropriate strategies to respond to youth behavior and eliminate the need for the continued detention of youth.\"\n\nBut I'm not sure exactly what is being posited here. Will addressing root causes, battling systemic racism, investing in families, etc., create a future where kids don't commit violent crimes? Or are they suggesting we can, through innovation, find some alternative to incarcerating kids who do commit violent crimes? Are we aiming for \"a system in which kids are not locked up for committing crimes\"? Or hoping to create a society in which kids are simply incapable of committing crimes?\n\nWhile doing less violence to kids\u2014economic violence, racial violence, domestic violence\u2014would certainly lead to less violence from kids, either outcome (no violent kids who might require incarceration, a non-custodial alternative to incarcerating violent kids) seems naively/ridiculously utopian.\n\nThe authors of that group editorial called for \"eventually eliminating youth detention,\" to their credit, not the immediate elimination of youth detention. So even they're aware that ending youth incarceration isn't something we can do next week. Even these advocates recognize that\u2014until proposed investments in restorative, individualized, and developmentally appropriate strategies begin paying whatever dividends they expect will be forthcoming\u2014some area youths are going to be incarcerated. And right now we can only incarcerate them in the \"toxic, cramped, and falling apart\" facility we have.\n\n\"It's not a functional building,\" a judge who works there told Cienna Madrid more than five years ago. \"It's filthy, it's decaying, and it sends an evil message to the primarily poor people who we see: 'You just don't matter.'\"\n\nWe're going to keep incarcerating kids around here. Even the adults pushing for an end to youth incarceration recognize that fact. We are, as Ana Sofia wrote yesterday, incarcerating a lot fewer kids than we used to, and activists deserve credit for driving those numbers down. Bravo. But holding the kids we're going to have to incarcerate for the foreseeable future in the facility we have now\u2014the toxic, cramped, and unsafe facility we have now\u2014is its own kind of violence.\n\nFighting for a just future\u2014ending systemic racism (and mass incarceration), investing in families and communities, making sure every kid is safe and supported\u2014is the right thing to do. Building a new, safe, non-toxic, and adaptable facility to house the kids we may have to incarcerate while we fight for that future? Also the right thing to do.",

    "text": "Across the Land: Proposed 10-year visa for over-50s\n\nThe proposed 10-year visa aims to target wealthy individuals over 50. Photo: American Advisors Group\n\nPHUKET: Finally, after years and years of consideration and watching other neighboring countries benefit from attracting foreign residents for long-term resident stays, the Thai government has announced a long term (ten-year) visa for foreigners over the age of 50.\n\n\n\nThe intention is to promote Thailand as an international hub for medical services. As Thailand plans to develop itself into a 'medical and wellness tourism' center, this is seen to be a good start in that direction.\n\n\n\nApplicants for this ten-year visa must have a monthly income of 100,000 baht or more than 3,000,000 baht in a Thai bank account (which cannot be withdrawn within the first year after receiving the visa). In addition to that, the applicant must have health insurance that provides a minimum of US$10,000 in annual coverage, including in-patient hospital stays. This visa will eventually replace the current one-year renewable visa for which the applicant must place 800,000 baht in a Thai bank account for a minimum of six months prior to visa application.\n\n\n\nThe proposed financial requirements will probably target the most affluent, as applicants cannot withdraw more than 50 per cent of those funds and they must prove that the funds withdrawn were spent in Thailand for services related to property, medical, school fees or any such related living expenses. The visa then allows the spouse of the applicant to apply for a Non-immigrant \u0091O\u2019 visa and for the children of the applicant who are under age 21 to apply for an education visa.\n\n\n\nWith the 10-year visa in place, Thailand can expect to draw more foreign residents to live in Thailand, and the targeted groups are from Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden, France, Finland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. The application fee is 10,000 baht. The foreign residents are mainly expected to live in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Chonburi, Phuket and Koh Samui.\n\n\n\nThis announcement will hopefully spur both local and foreign investors in the medical and wellness sectors, who will probably benefit the most from the implementation of this visa. This would also include those looking to create independent, active adult and assisted living communities. Independent active adult communities are dwelling homes or condominiums in a community where there are swimming pools, club houses, golf courses, spas, shops, hair dressers, medical care, shopping, restaurants, and transportation, all catering to residents who usually do not require any assistance for such day to day activities.\n\n\n\nThe criteria are somewhat the same for assisted living communities, where the substantial difference is additional care providers or more comprehensive medical care and attention.\n\n\n\nHowever, don\u2019t rush out to the nearest Thai embassy to apply for this ten-year visa, as the implementation date has not been announced and changes to the proposals may still take place.\n\n\n\nAmy Koh is the sales manager of Engel & Voelkers Phuket.

    "title": "Property Watch: Impact of weather on the property market",
    "text": "Property Watch: Impact of weather on the property market\n\nWeather is often ignored as a relevant factor when judging the property market. Photo: Gazette file\n\nPHUKET: A lot is said about the negatives and positives of the business and economics of the Phuket property market, but it seems that less is said about the realities of the weather here on our green and often wet island, and how that impacts on property.\n\n\n\nWhat is said is often encapsulated in a sugar-coated cloud of positivity \u0096 I recall the time there was a campaign within the property market among agents and the like to rename \u0091Monsoon Season/Wet Season\u2019 as the \u0091Green Season\u2019. This, like the drooping electric cables scattered between various concrete pillars, didn\u2019t really hold up to the test of time.\n\n\n\nBefore I launch into a property weather analysis, I would like to say that one of the reasons I moved to Thailand was for the tropical climate. I can further confirm that I didn\u2019t really know what tropical meant until I experienced its fluctuations year in and year out.\n\n\n\nOne of the main aspects of the weather system here means that new property looks great in high season, but if it isn\u2019t maintained it can quickly look like old property. This effectively means that asset management of an estate and maintenance of a property is very important and therefore buying a property can and should involve looking closely at the management plan.\n\n\n\nThere is a premium for property which faces the sea or is anywhere near a piece of sand and a glimpse of the sea is involved. The premium doesn\u2019t just involve the premium for the view, it involves having to re-sand, re-paint and recalibrate sun-warped sliding doors, replacing balcony wood and constantly redesigning overhead shade that perhaps the architect didn\u2019t think looked cool in the promotional 3D renderings but your family might appreciate as a respite when they visit.\n\n\n\nAside from the effect of salt and sun, there are quite wide ranging effects from water. It never ceases to amaze me, or the web forum trolls, that there appears to be great surprise expressed each year about the sheer volume of rainfall and that the rainfall is at its most intense for an average of 8 months out of the year.\n\n\n\nThe fact of the rainfall means that many houses without guttering will need it to prevent damage to their walls and structure. Further, the rain causes that freshly poured and oh-so-popular sandwash to become slimy and brown, unless you treat said sandwash with many chemicals and also employ your own jetwash or outsourced jetwashers to intervene.\n\n\n\nThe rain also causes legal disputes, fortunately or unfortunately depending on what business you are in. Seemingly unknown to many property developers and land owners, there is a provision in the civil and commercial code of Thailand which addresses this. The second part of section 1340 reads \u201c if any damage is suffered by reason of such artificial drainage [being from higher land] the owners of the land may, without prejudice to any claim for compensation, require the owner of the higher land, at the owner\u2019s expense, make drainage through lower land to a public waterway or drain.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere are, conveniently, some Supreme Court cases that support this principle, I am reliably informed.\n\n\n\nSo, as you watch the raindrops fall on the uneven road surfaces of our developing highways, consider for a moment the impact this water has on the property market here in Phuket and how it could affect your investment and expenses here. If you are busy drafting up a brochure describing the seasons, or reading such a brochure thinking about your \u0091usage rights\u2019, consider for a moment, how many times during the \u0091green season\u2019 the swimming pool will be used by you and how many times it will need to be cleaned. Consider how many times you might not be able to go to the beach in an eight-month rainy period, and how many times the roads and underpasses will flood, albeit temporarily.\n\n\n\nIf you are a contractor about to tell your employer that you will \u0091finish in 3 months, no problem\u2019, don\u2019t forget \u0096 it will rain, your workers will get wet, your materials will get wet and so on. And if you are planning on laying any electric cables \u0096 they may get wet too.\n\n\n\nBe under no doubt \u0096 Phuket is a green island, and still beautiful in my opinion, but it is also undoubtedly very wet.\n\n\n\nDesmond Hughes has been an owner and operator of his law firm in Thailand for 14 years, and is a Senior Partner at Hughes Krupica law firm hugheskrupica.com.\n\n\n\nThis article first appeared in the October 15-21 issue of the hard-copy Phuket Gazette newspaper.\n\n\n\nDigital subscribers may download the full newspaper, this week and every week, by clicking here.\n\n\n\nKeep checking the Phuket Gazette, join our Facebook fan page or follow us on Twitter @PhuketGazette for the latest news updates.\n\n\n\n",

Corroborating the information on the schedule page, MobileSyrup has received reports from multiple Rogers Moto Z users informing us they\u2019ve been able to download the update.\n\nWe\u2019re in the process of confirming whether the update is rolling out to Moto Z units on other networks. For the time being, it looks like Telus hasn\u2019t started pushing the update out to Moto Z devices on its network, even though its software update page says 7.0 was supposed to start rolling out to the Moto Z on December 19th.\n\nBesides adding 7.0-related features like multi-window support, bundled notifications and in-line replies, the update is notable for adding Daydream support. With Nougat, the Moto Z is the first third-party device to become compatible with Daydream, Google\u2019s new VR platform.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen a notification prompting you to update your Moto Z to Nougat, you can manually check for the update by launching the Settings app and navigating to About Phone > Software Update.\n\nThanks Neal and Jeff for the tips!",

    "title": "Horgan: San Mateo County should try a different approach with local landlords",
    "text": "With the decisive defeat of two Nov. 8 ballot measures that would have imposed tough rent control regulations in San Mateo and Burlingame, it\u2019s back to square one regarding some sort of assistance/safeguards for renters in those communities.\n\nHere\u2019s a suggestion: Instead of making landlords the routine villains in this situation, an ultra-tight housing market that shows few signs of easing significantly, why not work out a system for rewarding landlords who act with calculated decency in rental matters?\n\nIf memory serves, one of the public relations cudgels used by rent-control advocates in the run-up to the election was an unfortunate case in Burlingame in which an ill, elderly woman (and her roommate) was told to move to another dwelling because the property in question was to be sold due to urgent family estate issues.\n\nThis came about after she had lived in the cottage for decades at an extremely favorable rental rate that was far below what could have been charged in a red-hot Peninsula market.\n\nThe landlord, in spite of those many years of generosity and good will, was pilloried. He became a pariah once the case became public. He couldn\u2019t win.\n\nThen, before the election, the woman in question passed away at the age of 97, compounding what had become a campaign nightmare over which the landlord had little or no control. He was Public Enemy No.1.\n\nIn spite of concerted efforts by rent control activists to use the case as Exhibit A in their war on private property owners, the voters saw things quite differently overall. In the end, they crushed both rent control measures.\n\nBut none of the pressing housing issues has gone away.\n\nWho\u2019s elderly?\n\nBy the way, speaking of \u201celderly,\u201d how old do you have to be before you attain that label?\n\nThe dictionary is not much help. It defines \u201celderly\u201d as \u201cof advanced age\u201d or \u201cof or relating to persons in later life\u201d or just plain \u201cold.\u201d\n\nYears ago, I made a rather large mistake by referring to a 60-year-old man as being elderly in a news story in the defunct San Mateo Times. The publisher at the time, a rather feisty fellow who relished the notion of aging with vim and authority, happened to be 60 at the time.\n\nHe objected to the use of the descriptive word in that context. So how about 65? That used to be full retirement age for those claiming Social Security. No? Maybe 70 would be more like it. Not sure? I guess it\u2019s in the mind of the beholder.\n\nBut, for that publisher, 60 appeared to be the new 45. I learned that the hard way.\n\nPoplar proposal\n\nAs San Mateo officials, in concert with Caltrans, consider options to improve access to and from Highway 101 at Peninsula Avenue, here\u2019s a good suggestion from a neighbor in that immediate area: Retain the existing southbound 101 on-ramp (not the off-ramp) at Poplar Avenue to the south.\n\nDoing that would ease some of the anticipated traffic burden on San Mateo and Burlingame streets near an expanded Peninsula Avenue overpass system to the north. At least that\u2019s the theory.\n\nAnd, if it\u2019s feasible (the Poplar freeway access, both on and off 101, may have to be closed if the Peninsula interchange is re-configured to include southbound ramps), it makes some sense.\n\nJohn Horgan\u2019s column appears weekly.

Image: C9 Hotelworks Market Research\n\nPHUKET: For the most part, the booming tourist high season at the start of 2016 was a challenge for the island\u2019s luxury real estate sector, as there was no domino effect. Instead, the villa market went stone cold.\n\n\n\nAs we edge towards yet another winter peak high season though, the question for the property market is, \u201cwhat does the future hold?\u201d\n\n\n\nWe have just released the new \u0091C9 Hotelworks Phuket Luxury Villa Market Update\u2019 and based on our analysis, the prevailing market has seen a sharp rise of secondary sales against primary market transactions.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Bangkok and other Asian central business district offerings are now seeing a surge in overseas buyers at the top end of the market.\n\n\n\nTake note of the hotel branded residences on the river such as the Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental offerings \u0096 competition is heating up.\n\n\n\nYou can also factor in the global economic slowdown and volatile currency.\n\n\n\nYet if we turn back the clock and look at Asia\u2019s real estate post-global financial crisis, the ultra-luxury segment was one of the first markets to pick up and sustain traction during that time.\n\nBehind the push in Phuket\u2019s secondary sales is the reality that many of these villas are prime properties, so the choice is limited, and there are high entry barriers.\n\n\n\nThat means some early buyers are exiting as a normal trend in the recurring market cycle, not because of over-supply.\n\n\n\nGetting inside the numbers, I find comfort in knowing that the existing real estate market in luxury properties has a total value that is well in excess of US$1 billion.\n\n\n\nThe island\u2019s top-end market segment remains the best performer in the region.\n\n\n\nDrive around Phuket and you can do the math if you start adding up the existing values on Kamala\u2019s Millionaires Mile, Nai Thon, Bang Tao, Surin, Cape Yamu or Cape Panwa.\n\n\n\nLooking forward to the end of 2016 and into 2017, the pick-up of sales at Bill Heinecke\u2019s \u0091The Residences by Anantara\u2019 in Layan, signals the start of a new cycle.\n\n\n\nThere is strong interest at The Estates at MontAzure for its large land plots and signature design by celebrity designers Lek Bunnag and Jaya Ibrahim bodes well.\n\n\n\nIn the wings is the banner Rosewood resort. Its multimillion-dollar villas currently under development will usher in estate villas into the marketplace.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s no accident that Hong Kong\u2019s New World Development chose Phuket to locate their luxury brand\u2019s Asian flagship.\n\n\n\nAgain and again, we see the cyclical nature of the island\u2019s property market. While our new report spells out current trading challenges, our forecast is that we are about to enter a new cycle that will likely see a renewed interest in the impressive new top-grade products in the island\u2019s luxury segment.\n\n\n\nThis article first appeared in the October 8-14 issue of the hard-copy Phuket Gazette newspaper.\n\n\n\nDigital subscribers may download the full newspaper, this week and every week, by clicking here.\n\n\n\nKeep checking the Phuket Gazette, join our Facebook fan page or follow us on Twitter @PhuketGazette for the latest news updates.\n\n\n\n",

Chinese arrivals to Japan doubled on a year-on-year basis in 2015, thanks to the rapid depreciation of the yen and more accommodating visa policies.\n\n\n\nThailand remains the top destination for Chinese outbound tourists (excluding Hong Kong) with 71.7 per cent year-on-year growth in Chinese arrivals to Thailand last year.\n\n\n\nHowever, according to research by the Financial Times, Chinese tourists generally spend the largest portion of their budget on shopping and just a small portion on accommodation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the first half of this year, Chinese arrivals have continued to be Thailand\u2019s largest feeder market, making up 30 per cent of tourist arrivals into the Kingdom, and accounted for 38 per cent of total arrivals to Phuket. Hotel performance here has continued to be driven mainly by strong Chinese arrivals with record high occupancy the first half of the year,\u201d reported James Pitchon, Head of Research & Consulting at CBRE Thailand.\n\n\n\n\u201cChina will continue to lead growth in outbound travel and spending. While previously Chinese tourists may have seemed reluctant to spend big on accommodation, there are signs that they are beginning to take a greater interest in hotel quality and service. This is a significant opportunity, but hoteliers need to ensure they provide a service offering that meets the requirements of this increasingly important demographic,\u201d commented Robert McIntosh, Executive Director at CBRE Hotels, Asia Pacific.\n\n\n\nResearch indicates that Chinese tourists are not overly price sensitive toward accommodation. A 2013 survey found that only 10 per cent of respondents selected price as their most important consideration when selecting a place to stay on an overseas trip.\n\n\n\n\u201cChinese tourists are most concerned about the comfort, star rating and facilities offered by hotels, along with a hotel\u2019s reputation and recommendations by friends and family and/or travel sites. Cultural and language barriers, such as Mandarin speaking staff, signs and literature were also seen as important and Chinese travellers are increasingly demanding that hotels provide them with tailored services that better fit their culture, while helping them to overcome the language barrier,\u201d Mr McIntosh added.\n\n\n\nShared Accommodation Poses Major Challenge\n\n\n\nWhile the increase in Chinese outbound tourists will drive demand for accommodation, the rise of shared accommodation poses a major challenge for the traditional hotel industry.\n\n\n\nAdvances in technology have made it possible for hosts to offer rooms or apartments for short-term rental via online platforms. Airbnb is the market leader, covering more than 191 countries and offering more than two million rooms or apartments for rent. Other active players include HomeAway, FlipKey, Rommorama and national level operators such as Tujia in China and Homie in Singapore.\n\n\n\nThis article first appeared in the October 1-7 issue of the hard-copy Phuket Gazette newspaper.\n\n\n\nDigital subscribers may download the full newspaper, this week and every week, by clicking here.\n\n\n\nKeep checking the Phuket Gazette, join our Facebook fan page or follow us on Twitter\n\n@PhuketGazette for the latest news updates.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "These six utopian cities of the future will help you re-imagine life on Earth",
    "text": "\n\nAlan Marshall, Author provided\n\nUtopia, a book by English statesman, lawyer and clergyman Thomas More (1487-1535), turns 500 years old this month.\n\nA fictional rendering of social philosophy, the book describes an exemplary society on an imaginary island in an unknown place faraway across the seas.\n\nCoined by More from the Greek ou-topos, meaning no place, or nowhere, the word utopia has become adopted in the English language to mean a place where everything is ideal or perfect.\n\nIn celebrating Utopia's 500th birthday, the Ecotopia 2121 project, of which I am the coordinator, is harnessing Thomas More's spirit to predict the futures of 100 real cities around the world - if they somehow managed to become super eco-friendly.\n\nOf course, modern utopias need to be eco-friendly to overcome the global environmental crisis. Given that cities may be home to 80% of humanity by the end of the century, they can only be sustainable if environmentalism is one of their core features.\n\nThe cities of Ecotopia 2121 are presented in the form of \"scenario art\", which involves a review of both global and local environmental challenges as well as their unique histories and cultures. This allows for a diversity of future scenarios rather than one common vision of the \"future city\".\n\nWhat you will see below are a series of artworks, but this is not an art project. We use art as a means of analysis and communication.\n\nWith that in mind, here are six ecotopian cities of my own creation that emerged from the project, one from each inhabited continent.\n\nAccra 2121\n\nAccra, the capital of Ghana, is exposed to disastrous floods every year. This has been made worse by climate change, as well as unregulated construction and dumping in and around its waterways.\n\nIn our imagined future, locals seek to procure housing above the floodline, by building low-cost tree cabins in the nearby forest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Marshall, Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, but by 2121, the forest has become a home for some of its citizens.\n\nAccra's new residents would protect the forest ecosystem from those who would destroy it, such as the logging, mining and oil companies.\n\nLondon 2121\n\nIn the summer of 2121, during an economic downturn, 100,000 pensioners take to the streets of London, the British capital, to protest cuts in pensions and education, shutting down the entire city.\n\nThey bring along their grandchildren to give them something interesting to do as they mind them. By summer's end, the protesters despair at the government's poor response, so they take matters into their own hands, staging a permanent occupation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Marshall, Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pensioners convert some 20km\u00b2 of London into a large eco-village, transforming unoccupied offices into homes, sowing garden lots on street corners, and setting up eco-businesses to trade products and services.\n\nIn the process, all the children get free education from their experienced elders in these various green arts and crafts.\n\nLos Angeles 2121\n\nThe southern Californian city of Los Angeles once had a great network of tramways, but this was systematically bought up and then closed down by a group of conspiring auto-manufacturing companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Marshall, Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the world's oil is depleted by the end of this century, cars will become useless and trams could make a comeback in Los Angeles. The unused freeways could then be redeveloped into vegetated greenways. Such greenways are suited for pedestrians and cyclists, but they could also act as ecological corridors, connecting populations of wild plants and animals around the city that would otherwise be isolated.\n\nRetired cars could then serve as part of the fabric of high-density buildings, creating an architectural style whereby people live and work in smaller structures and within tighter-knit communities. This would mean cities such as Los Angeles would not need to sprawl further into the countryside and wild lands.\n\nR\u0113kohu 2121\n\nKnown in English as the Chatham Islands, R\u0113kohu is an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, 680km southeast of New Zealand. It's the ancestral home of the pacifist Moriori people, who came to wear the feathers of the native albatross in their hair to symbolise peace during the 500 years they lived on the archipelago.\n\nIn the 19th century, British sealers and Maori warriors from New Zealand discovered the islands. The sealers decimated the colonies of the animals and introduced devastating diseases to which the Moriori had no immunity. Then the Maori staged a violent takeover of the islands, slaughtering or enslaving the remaining Moriori.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Marshall, Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moriori refused to give up their pacifist ideals to fight against the invaders. While this history suggests pacifism is only going to get you killed or enslaved, the Moriori who survive today believe otherwise. They maintain that their pacifism meant that they lived in a peaceful society for five centuries.\n\nBy 2121, their small capital city on the lagoon is home to a peace school that expounds the virtues of pacifism to the rest of the world.\n\nSalto del Guair\u00e1 2121\n\nThe Guair\u00e1 Falls along the border of Paraguay and Brazil were once a natural wonder. The cacophonous roar of their seven columns could be heard many kilometres away and, for many years, the falls were a major attraction. They were also the economic lifeblood of the nearby Paraguayan city of Salto del Guair\u00e1, which thrived on tourism.\n\nIn 1982, however, the Brazilian military government blew away the rocks over which the water fell, to create a reservoir for a dam. Many Paraguayans mourned the passing of their much-loved falls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Marshall, Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2121, though, both the falls and the city have re-emerged in splendid style. The dam has collapsed through neglect and local people have regained control of their land. They set about rehabilitating the falls as best they can, turning their home into a scenic eco-city that attracts tourists once again.\n\nTokyo 2121\n\nAfter a nuclear meltdown just out of town, a vast radioactive cloud sweeps over future Tokyo. Everyone must be evacuated. A few hardy \"nuclear families\" tough it out in \"moonbase\" homes, which are impervious to radiation.\n\nEverything these families eat and drink must be produced and recycled within these homes. When they step outside, they must don protective clothing or \"moonsuits\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Marshall, Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nBut because Tokyo is suddenly depopulated, it's not nearly as noisy and stressful as before. If \"hell is other people\", as French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre suggested, then Tokyo 2121 is utopia.\n\nWildlife also rebounds, albeit in a mutated manner.\n\nWhy Ecotopia 2121?\n\nThese six scenarios are but a small sample of the 100 that were produced within the Ecotopia 2121 project. Some readers will be delighted and others confused by the method of the project and its results.\n\nPart of the point of utopianism is to be provocative. If you like your future riddled with self-driving cars and the magic of nuclear energy, then maybe these scenarios are not for you. And you're likely to dismiss them as fantasy anyway.\n\nBut to study utopias - and formulate alternative scenarios to how we now live on this planet - is not an escape into fantasy. It is an active response to the many technological fantasies cast about with extravagance and excess into our lives right now.\n\nThese fantasies bind us to an unsustainable and unlivable future. If Ecotopia 2121 is but a collection of fantasies, at least they would do less harm to the planet we live on.\n\nAlan Marshall, Lecturer in Environmental Social Sciences, Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Mahidol University\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

    "text": "A ten minute rule bill put forward by a Sussex MP yesterday is a \u2018practical way\u2019 to give \u2018power back to aggrieved passengers\u2019, he said.\n\nTim Loughton, Member of Parliament for East Worthing and Shoreham, put forward a bill in the House of Commons that would establish a network-wide rail ombudsman and redesign the system of compensation.\n\nThe bill seeks to solve the issues of compensation and redress by creating a new scheme in which, every time a train is late beyond an agreed threshold, a penalty fine will be paid into a central pot independent of train operation companies.\n\nThe \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of the pot will be to compensate passengers who will be able to make claim in a \u2018much simpler way than present\u2019, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe pot would also be used to fund a new rail ombudsman, which would manage compensation claims, rather than the train operating companies.\n\nThe ombudsman, which would have \u2018real teeth\u2019 and \u2018proper statutory powers\u2019, would be based on the Energy Ombudsman model which is already in operation and could be adapted in the rail sector, the spokesperson said.\n\nAny remaining funds from the central pot would be used to offset fare rises \u2018thereby giving further payback to inconvenienced passengers\u2019, the spokesperson said.\n\nMr Loughton said: \u201cThe Govia Thameslink franchise which includes Southern Rail is not working and has not been doing so for some time.\n\n\u201cMy Bill would recalibrate the balance of power back to aggrieved passengers.\n\n\u201cMy Bill alone is not an immediate solution but does represent a practical way forward to change the dynamics within the rail industry.\n\n\u201cMost of my constituents are primarily concerned with being able to use a reliable rail service that gets them where they want to be roughly when they anticipated rather than compensation for an unreliable service.\n\n\u201cHowever the two are not mutually exclusive and I believe my Bill will help to achieve both.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live.\n\nHere are four ways you can be sure you\u2019ll be amongst the first to know what\u2019s going on.\n\n1) Make our website your homepage\n\n2) Like our Facebook page\n\n3) Follow us on Twitter\n\n4) Register with us by clicking on \u2018sign in\u2019 (top right corner).

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review: form meets function",
    "text": "Samsung overhauled its flagship Galaxy S smartphone series with a premium design in 2015. This came with some tough decisions, however, and microSD card support and water resistance were both dropped. Still, the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge+ were high performers last year. Now in 2016, Samsung has stepped back in time to re-introduce memory expansion and water resistance with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. In this Galaxy S7 Edge review, we\u2019ll take a look at how this year is the one in which the Galaxy S evolved into its most perfect state yet. Samsung Galaxy S7 review\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy S7 comparison\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 vs Galaxy S7 Edge comparison Update: Samsung confirmed the Blue Coral variant of its S7 Edge. Head down to our 'design and build quality' section to see how it looks.\n\nHighlight recent changes Yes No\n\nRating\n\nGood \u2713 Excellent grip\n\n\u2713 Excellent screen quality\n\n\u2713 Floating Game Tools button\n\n\u2713 Camera focus speed\n\n\u2713 Wider f/1.7 aperture (bright pictures)\n\n\u2713 microSD card support\n\n\u2713 Water resistance Bad \u2715 Does not support Adoptable Storage\n\n\u2715 Fingerprint sensor fails in the rain\n\n\u2715 Mono speaker\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge design and build quality The biggest difference between the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge is display size, at 5.1 inches and 5.5 inches respectively. However, even with an increase of 0.4 inches, the S7 Edge is surprisingly compact. Compared to previous dual-edge models, the S7 Edge is more beautiful, offers excellent grip and the camera bulge has been almost completely removed. To get an idea, the camera's rear bulge decreased to 0.46 mm and is virtually nonexistent. The Galaxy S7 Edge has a 3,600 mAh battery, but it's still elegant. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT In short, this device is beautiful. In fact, I think the S7 Edge is the best-looking phone you can buy right now. Build materials are top notch, with an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass 4 on front and rear. This means that you\u2019ll have extra protection against cracks, but it\u2019s not unbreakable like the Moto X Force. The camera's rear bulge decreased to 0.46 mm and is virtually non-existent. The Galaxy S7 Edge screen is 2.5D. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT In the Galaxy S7 Edge, the metal edges on both sides are quite narrow, as you can see in the images. This gives it a clear visual difference between it and the iPhone. (L to R) Headphone jack, micro USB port, microphone and speaker. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT At the top is the nano SIM card and microSD slot. Once you open it, you\u2019ll find a tray to insert both cards. Memory can be expanded up to 200 GB via microSD. The Galaxy S7 Edge has a tray for microSD and SIM cards. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT At the bottom is the speaker and, just like the S6 Edge+, is a micro USB port and the headphone jack. I honestly think Samsung should invest in stereo speakers as with such a high-quality display it seems like the minimum acceptable standard. For stereo audio, you\u2019ll need to settle for using headphones. Don't get me wrong - I don\u2019t like someone beside me on the subway using their phone's loudspeaker, but at home it would have been nice. The Galaxy S7 Edge fingerprint sensor is fast. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT As seen in previous models of the line, the Galaxy S7 Edge also uses the home button as a fingerprint scanner. The configuration of this feature is fast and works well. However, the Galaxy S7 Edge is certified IP68 for dust and water resistance. This means you can use the device for about 30 minutes at a depth of 1.5m of water. When my finger or the device itself is wet, the fingerprint reader does not work however, so if you\u2019re at home cooking and your hand is wet, the device will not unlock. The solution here is to use Smart Lock to make the device recognize trusted locations and remain unlocked. The camera is a barely-visible lump. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT I think Samsung\u2019s choice to launch a dual-edge model at 5.5 inches instead of 5.1 inches, unlike last year, was a smart move. This is because the differences between the Galaxy S7 and S7 Galaxy Edge would be very small. If the company was still considering launching the \"Plus\" version of this device, it would need to make huge changes to avoid launching two very similar devices. The Galaxy S7 Edge is only slightly larger than the Galaxy S7. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT So far, Samsung released five different colors for its Galaxy S7 Edge device: Black Onyx, Gold Platinum, White Pearl, Silver Titanium and Pink Gold. Now, Coral Blue is being added to the lineup. It's available starting November 1, in select markets around the world. The color is really a combination of two different tones. A bluish hue on the front and back with a gold border running around the border. Have a look at the official renders below. Samsung is planning to release a new color in December. Photos have just been leaked by a Samsung official on their Weibo account of a \"Glossy Black\" version of the Galaxy S7 Edge, which look similar to Apple's iPhone 7 in Jet Black. You can expect the new Glossy Black color in December. / \u00a9 Weibo The Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge color. / \u00a9 Screenshot AndroidPIT\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge display The S7 Edge inherited the screen resolution of its predecessor rather jumping to 4K. On the one hand this could be a frustrating choice for a device launched under the guise of a virtual reality revolution. However, the S7 Edge display leaves nothing to be desired in quality when it comes to everyday use. The handset comes with a Super AMOLED display of 5.5 inches and, of course, what makes it unique are the curved lateral edges. The WQHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 provides a pixel density of 534 ppi (pixel per square inch). Color saturation is one of the best on any device with an AMOLED display. Viewing angles are very good, with the ability to identify what is on the screen with the device at an angle of 80 to 85 degrees. What is striking is that Samsung really pumped up maximum brightness. That could be annoying when you\u2019re in a dark room, especially when you are reading at night. However, there\u2019s a significant improvement in readability during the day. Between the two, I am happy to see better readability under direct sunlight and you could just always adjust brightness manually anyway. The Galaxy S7 Edge display makes media look better. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT The screen\u2019s curved edges are also a benefit to the Gear VR. When you use the Galaxy S7, by comparison, it is possible to see the side edges of the phone. With the S7 Edge, you can't.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge special features Game Launcher For the first time, I had the impression that Samsung brought something really special to its smartphones in relation to software functions. The Game Launcher functions as a center for games and automatically adds games to a specific folder that will suggest titles you might like. But what is even better in the Game Launcher are its features, such as options to save battery while you play, choose to stop alerts while you play, access the most popular games, featured videos and, most interesting of all, enable the floating button \u2018Game Tool\u2019. The Game Tool employs some Google Play Games features, such as being able to record matches to share with other users. The tool is useful, especially for those who use their phones to play but have no patience for capacitive keys that end up being activated unintentionally during a match, thus hampering the gaming experience. The Game Tool is functional and can be accessed by a floating button. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT The Galaxy S7 Edge is, along with the Galaxy S7, one of the first smart phones compatible with the Vulkan API. This API has been designed to complement existing technologies like OpenGL and OpenGL ES. The goal is that in the near future Vulkan will become a standard for creating graphics solutions in 3D, both on PC and on mobile devices. Of course, this API is not exclusive of the new Galaxy S line, but shows how Samsung is committed to making the gaming experience better. USB adapter to replace lack of USB Type-C We all know that Samsung invested in a breathtaking presentation for the launch of the Galaxy S7 Edge. To the surprise of those who attended the launch, Samsung made use of its virtual reality gadget, the Gear VR, during the show. I have to say that the experience with 360-degree video was great. But have you ever wondered what would happen if the company changed the micro USB port from Type-B to Type-C? It would have to redesign all its accessories, and with it, the Gear VR. Transferring data from one device to another is easy using the adapter Samsung provides. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT To streamline any port connectivity issues, Samsung provides a micro USB adapter with the Galaxy S7 Edge so you can connect it to any device with micro USB port. This allows you to share files quickly, as I saw when I downloaded my entire Galaxy S7 Edge picture gallery onto my Xperia Z2 in a matter of minutes.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge software The Galaxy S7 Edge comes with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and TouchWiz has not changed much compared to the Galaxy S6 Edge+ or Galaxy Note 5. This Samsung skin, as we know, was overhauled last year, lightened, bloatware removed and features optimized. Yet the system still takes up little more than 7 GB of internal memory. Remember that the 32 GB you pay for ends up as only 25 GB of usable space. In the Galaxy S7 Edge we can see Android 6.0 Marshmallow features brought over to TouchWiz, such as changes to the arrangement and layout of the status bar and improved quick shortcuts. Previous problems, such as with RAM usage, have been resolved. TouchWiz does not bother me as it's definitely more intelligent. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT Regarding bloatware, we have seven apps from Samsung, five from Microsoft, and, of course, Google Apps, Facebook and WhatsApp. But there are still another 25 pre-installed apps. However, the system proved to be clever, because when you start using the S7 Edge these apps don\u2019t show up, and neither was the Game Launcher the default application for use with the Gear VR. However, when downloading my first game, the system automatically offered the option to enable the Game Launcher. The same happened when placing the Gear VR on and the phone automatically asked by a voice command to download Oculus services. But on removing the device from the virtual reality headset, it was already set to download the software. Edge Screen The \u2018Edge Screen\u2019 is dedicated to dual-edge models and allows you to slide your finger from a tab on the right of the screen to access a list of services. The service was known as the link function in the past, which still exists and offers the chance to add up to five favorite contacts, identified with different colors, as a kind of shortcut to the main contacts from your address book. The Edge Screen feature had some changes. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT However, Samsung has expanded the range of the Edge Screen functions and can now add two columns instead of just one to access a greater number of features. You can add your favorite websites, too. This feature is cool but, honestly, I\u2019m not sure if this would convince me to opt for the Galaxy S7 Edge over the Galaxy S7. Always On The possibility of having information available 24 hours from the Always On feature is already available on this model. The thing, however, is that it can be quite invasive when you simply don\u2019t want the display to show you anything.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge performance The Galaxy S7 Edge comes with an Exynos 8890 processor. The CPU was developed by Samsung and comes with eight cores, four of them running at a maximum speed of 2.3 GHz and the other four at up to 1.6 GHz. According to Samsung, the CPU and GPU are 30 percent and 64 percent more potent, respectively, than the Galaxy S6. When we look at the results of benchmarking by Metal and Multicore\u2019s Vellamo, we see that the first, which measures the maximum performance in an operation, the CPU frequency is much of the time overclocked or 2.6 GHz. Thus, taking into account that the majority of Android applications use only two processor cores when running, the Galaxy S7 Edge delivers maximum performance the entire time. The size means the time the device spends at a given frequency. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT This is, of course, only on paper. In real life, I had days when the software did not give me a headache or plain ran without crashes or delays. However, one day I downloaded four big games: Need for Speed No Limits, Asphalt 8, the Real Racing 3 and the Gods of Rome. During this time, I started to play one after another and I used almost 4 GB of data. My colleague, Sophia Neun, installed the Need for Speed No Limits and Real Racing 3 on the Galaxy S7 Edge and she did not have the same problems. The problems I had with Need for Speed No Limits could also be related to my internet connection. Moreover, the problem with background applications lock that has become a problem in the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus is not present in the S7 Edge. I had more than 50 applications running in the background with no system delays. 53 apps are open in the background and the system is still running fluidly. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT Below, you can see a table with the results of different benchmarks from the Galaxy S7 Edge: Vellamo - metal Vellamo - multicore AnTuTu Geekbench 3 - single core Geekbench 3 - multicore v3.2.3 v3.2.3 v6.0.4 v3.3.2 v3.3.2 2.163 points 3.424 points 131.202 points 1.883 points 6.173 points The device I\u2019m testing has 32 GB of internal memory and 4 GB of RAM. In it, I\u2019m using a Samsung 120 GB SD card. The fact that the manufacturer offered an expandable memory option is great for storing photos and other media. But don\u2019t get confused, you cannot use the microSD as internal memory. Looking at the examples above and below, you see that even after moving a 1.22 GB game in the device memory to the external memory, the external storage is only occupied by 492 MB. Also, when I search for applications in the device memory, Asphalt 8 is among them, in Settings > Storage > Device Memory > Used space > Applications. You can still save app data to microSD card with the Galaxy S7 Edge. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT Samsung in the United States told Arstechnica in February that it chose against Adoptable Storage, stating that \" our users want a microSD card to transfer files between their phone and other devices (laptop, tablet, etc), especially the photos and videos they shoot with the camera.\" In addition, the manufacturer claimed that misuse of this feature may cause the card to \u201cbe erased the first time it is inserted into the device.\" You have to keep in mind that, though the Galaxy S7 Edge is running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, its microSD card functionality is the same as we had in the Galaxy S5: you can\u2019t just add a 32 GB card to the 32 GB S7 Edge to create a 64 GB device.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge audio Apparently, Samsung has yet to evolve on the question of speaker quality. The speaker audio is high but that does not mean it\u2019s necessarily good. Playing Spotify albums at home or indoors is not a problem at 75 percent of the volume, but after that, depending on the genre of music, the audio is noisy. The worst thing, is Samsung really invested in this device for consuming media and put a great screen on the device for gaming. However, in most cases, plugging in an external speaker while playing games or watching video is necessary. To get better sound quality, you can use the headphones that provide stereo audio. However, if you are gaming, the timing in gameplay will be distorted. The speaker of the Galaxy S7 Edge is at the bottom of the device. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT Just as we saw in the Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy Note 5 models, among others, Samsung offers an audio equalizer for the Galaxy S7 Edge, which can be used to optimize the sound of videos and songs that do not use players like Spotify. So with the headphones (via cable or Bluetooth) you can see an improvement in the audio effects, but beware, this is not a cure-all. The headphones come in the kit which includes the power adapter and USB. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT The Galaxy S7 Edge kit includes a headset for two different ear sizes. A radio is not included in the device so you\u2019ll have to use a streaming radio that uses data if you want to use this. The audio quality for calls is good. The speaker is great and the microphone is able to capture voice and filter out background noise. The size of the device does not interfere with audio quality for calls.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge camera The camera of the Galaxy S7 Edge is one of the major highlights of the device. The new sensor with an f / 1.7 aperture does an excellent job in poor lighting and the larger pixels assist in the sharpness of images in these conditions. The result is quite impressive, I used the camera to take pictures at night and can easily see what was shot on the screen in vivid detail. The Galaxy S7 Edge camera has a lower resolution than the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus but the sensor uses dual 12 MP technology. This means that all pixels of the image sensor photodiodes have two instead of one. Thus, the sensor is able to focus quickly. When an object in focus rapidly changes position, like a moving car, the camera focuses almost instantly. Samsung claims that the Galaxy S7 Edge takes 95 percent brighter photos, which is 56 percent more light than with previous models. Because the test was not done in a controlled environment, I cannot say definitively whether this figures are completely accurate. However, analyzing the images captured with the camera, they certainly have improved greatly in this regard. The front camera has an aperture of f/1.7 and remains at 5 MP. Will the S7 cameras be the new kings of the market? Below you can see some images from the main camera: All images captured with the Galaxy S7 Edge can be seen in full size on Google+ An image captured with the Galaxy S7 Edge camera. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT Macro mode for the Galaxy S7 Edge camera. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT The camera controls are very intuitive, just slide your finger across the screen to access the different camera modes and the gallery. To exit the gallery, and go straight to the camera, just swipe your finger from left to right on the screen. Capturing images is also done in various ways, especially when using the front camera. Therefore, you can use the touch screen, the volume buttons, heartbeat sensor and standard camera button. The Galaxy S7 Edge\u2019s camera offers a manual mode and a way to make collages. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT Camera modes There are some camera modes that are worth mentioning in this review. The gallery mode now offers the moving picture feature, so you can show the images on the display with greater detail. Two other video resources are the \u2018interval\u2019 (time-lapse) and slow motion. You can watch a sequence of several pictures showing them as time passed. But the slow movement uses three different speeds, like \u00bd, \u00bc and \u215b. You can also choose a specific part of the sequence you want slower. The slow motion mode offers three speeds. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT The front camera also offers modes for correction and highlighting certain parts of faces in selfies or group photos. The color representation provides an excellent saturation both in pictures and videos. What draws the most attention for the Galaxy S7 Edge is the maintenance of colors, richness of detail, the speed of focus and the excellent color saturation.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge battery The Galaxy S7 Edge comes with a battery capacity of 3600 mAh without using any accessories. If we compare this with the previous model, the Galaxy S6 Edge, we are talking about an increase of 1000 mAh. This is due to a few factors, like the increased size of the screen. But in particular, Samsung has used a new flexible battery technology that is able to take advantage of extra space inside the body. These two accessories help charge the battery. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT The S7 Edge has wireless charging and fast charging technology. In my tests, I tested only with the adapter and cable, but it was still very quick. When the device was at 5 percent, I only need one hour and 16 minutes to reach 100 percent. So if you are in a hurry, you will have no problem charging the device for just 30 minutes. This was the amount of time it took me to charge to 43 percent from 5 percent. In addition to this, Samsung maintained its well-known power saving modes. Of course, you will be limited on the use of the device in these modes. In fact, the S7 Edge software was optimized to save energy. When I launched the Game Launcher, for example, I got the option of \u2018saving energy during games\u2019. I prefer to keep power saving options turned off most of the time because I wanted the pictures at a normal resolution. If you need the \u2018save energy\u2019 option though, it does deliver a very good experience and yet consumes less power. As soon as you open the Game Launcher, you can choose to save energy during the game. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT Below you have an example of the Galaxy S7 Edge in use for nearly 24 hours. From 9 PM Sunday to 5 PM Monday, the device went from 100 percent to 20 percent battery remaining. The smartphone reached 5 percent at 8:45 PM and this was with three AnTuTu benchmark test run. It consumed 30 percent of the battery during the day, so the battery would have endured a lot more without the benchmark tests. A look at the Galaxy S7 Edge battery consumption. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge technical specifications\n\nType: Phone Model: G935F Manufacturer: Samsung Dimensions: 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm Weight: 157 g Battery size: 3600 mAh Screen size: 5.5 in Display technology: AMOLED Screen: 2560 x 1440 pixels (534 ppi) Front camera: 5 megapixels Rear camera: 12 megapixels Flashlight: LED Android version: 6.0 - Marshmallow User interface: TouchWiz RAM: 4 GB Internal storage: 32 GB\n\n64 GB Removable storage: microSD Chipset: Samsung Exynos 8890 Number of cores: 8 Max. clock speed: 2.3 GHz Connectivity: HSPA, LTE, NFC, Bluetooth 4.2\n\n\n\nFinal verdict The Galaxy S7 Edge is everything its predecessor was and more. The device design, software and camera have improved as you would expect, only now we also have a stronger battery, more power, a microSD card slot, and water resistance. Samsung has managed to better the design of its predecessor in almost every way. While in the S6 Edge will felt there was something missing, the Galaxy S7 Edge is a complete package, a smartphone with a soul. Because time around, not only does it look beautiful, but it has much to offer on the inside.",

    "title": "County Currents: Supporting military veterans with housing programs",
    "text": "Tony Harrison served five years in the U.S. Army, and was stationed in the United States and abroad, including Iraq. His life was going pretty well when he was discharged in 2006. He bought a condo and had a good job. And then when the economy crashed, everything started to unravel.\n\nHe had to short sell his home, he lost his job and, in his words, \u201cthings just crashed.\u201d\n\nHe rented a room for $500 until the rent was raised to $800, and he could no longer afford it. Even though he had a security job at the time, he had to start living out of his car. After he learned he may qualify for a Veterans Administration housing voucher, Tony began to see a glimmer of hope.\n\nHis Veterans Administration Supportive Housing application was accepted, so armed with a monthly stipend, he began to look for an apartment. In two months, he filled out 26 applications. Some property managers put him on a waiting list, and 16 others charged a fee for processing the applications, ranging from $25 to $50 each. He was turned down 26 times.\n\nIn September 2015, the day before the voucher was to expire, a property owner rented him a two-bedroom apartment in South San Jose, providing him, \u201ca place to come home to.\u201d\n\nHis experience as a homeless veteran also led him to his new job with the San Jose Downtown Streets Team, a nonprofit that helps homeless people get back on their feet through employment and housing. Part of his job is to approach landlords, talking to them about giving homeless people a chance to live under a roof and turn their lives around.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been through something like this and you have a chance to help other people, you\u2019re happy to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been there and you don\u2019t want anyone to feel the way you felt.\u201d\n\nIn November 2015, the county and the City of San Jose launched \u201cAll the Way Home,\u201d a campaign run by Destination: Home to house the 703 veterans who are without permanent housing, according to the 2015 Homeless Census. Like Tony, about 260 of them have housing vouchers but, in today\u2019s competitive market, cannot find a place to rent.\n\nWe need you to join the campaign. If you have a room, apartment, condo or home to rent, please contact my office immediately or come to an informational meeting at 6 p.m. on April 26 in the Board Chambers at the County Government Center located at 70 W. Hedding St. in San Jose to find out about the financial incentives that the County is offering to landlords who rent to veterans.\n\nNo one who served our country should sleep under a freeway overpass, in a tent near a creek or on a sidewalk. They fought for us and now we need to fight for them.\n\nYou can contact my office at (408) 299-5030 or email me at dave.cortese@bos.sccgov.org.",

    "title": "Should you install an antivirus on your Android device?",
    "text": "We're often asked whether its necessary to install an antivirus an Android smartphone, and with good reason. Apple has tried to discredit Android by presenting as a system infected with viruses and malware. The flaws that have come to the surface in recent years haven\u2019t helped to reassure Android users. Those who have used their computer without an antivirus will be able to back this up: the results can be dramatic, except for those more knowledgeable users who can manage to escape unscathed. So, should you be suspicious of malware, viruses and Trojans of any kind on your Android device?\n\nAre there risks if you don\u2019t install an antivirus on your Android device?\n\nUntil now, very few Android devices have had viruses - at least if you compare them to the number of computers that have been infected with them. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that an Android smartphone or tablet is invulnerable. Mobile web browsing has seen an unprecedented increase in virus activity, and we are already aware that any mobile internet browsing has risks. Recently, the danger of infection by a virus is more likely with Trojans like Obad which have quickly gained the reputation as the most dangerous virus that has ever been identified. It will not be the last.\n\nThis type of blackmail is never pleasant. / \u00a9 Sophos\n\nIs Android more vulnerable than Apple\u2019s iOS?\n\nWe often hear that Apple has no virus problems and that it\u2019s not necessary to install an antivirus on Android. This is both true and false: Apple is a more closed system than Android, therefore it is much more difficult to enter the system to develop a virus. As a result, it's logical that these virus developers opt to target Android\u2019s open system. The intrinsic functioning of Android has it faults, and its these faults that are used by the viruses. That said, iPhone users are much less vigilant of viruses than other users but they are also vulnerable.\n\nAntivirus and Android, what a story. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nIs the Play Store a safe bet?\n\nYes and no. In theory, Google has deleted and forbidden any applications which contain viruses or spybots. Unfortunately, this filter isn\u2019t foolproof: we saw it with the number of false versions of iFruit (GTA) to emerge when Android users were waiting for its release to their devices. The Google Play Store cannot be completely trusted. Some advice: before installing an application look at the number of downloads and the number of positive comments for the app, but also the authorizations. This is a good strategy for Android users to determine whether an app can be trusted.\n\n\n\nThat said, the new algorithm implemented by Google is now able to more efficiently filter the Play Store, that way users don\u2019t encounter any nasty surprises. Again, be careful of what you download. Often a malicious virus can be hidden in an application that looks kosher, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s important to check the name of the developer or the business that edited this application, as well as the number of downloads, comments and authorizations.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle is continually cleaning up its app store. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nWhat is at risk if I find a virus?\n\nThe main risks aren\u2019t very serious but they can be problematic for some: gathering your personal data and redistributing this information. That is best case scenario. You could also lose all your data, find an application that empties your battery or find yourself with corrupt files. If you consider the fact that our phones often contain much more personal information than our computers (phone numbers, email addresses, photos\u2026), there\u2019s no doubt that the risk of such an attack is much more dire for mobile devices.\n\nHow can a virus get onto my device?\n\nMany everyday tasks can be dangerous for your Android device: from downloading an app to reading your emails or even by simply surfing the net. But its not all about the internet. It's also possible for viruses to be transferred via Bluetooth or Infrared if you find yourself close to an infected device. This could happen when you're out in public, at a friend's place or even in your own home.\n\nThe distribution of viruses can be much quicker than on a computer, as we can carry this virus in our pockets everywhere we go. It\u2019s advisable to regularly run a check with an antivirus.\n\nSecurity is important on Android, especially when you use your smartphone to pay for items. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of an antivirus on Android?\n\nOne of the main criticisms about antiviruses is that they play on fears about viruses, as they require full access to all user data on a device. Essentially, they do exactly the same thing as the viruses you are trying to avoid\u2026 and you need to have confidence in your antivirus. Some antiviruses are also energy intensive: they are always running in the background and are not always optimized for batteries. It\u2019s often the price you'll have to pay to be protected\u2026 Finally, an antivirus will not always be 100% effective. While some like Avast, Kaspersky or Lookout find 90% of viruses, others like McAfee will detect only a few of the dangers.\n\nWhich antivirus should I choose for Android?\n\nThis will largely depend on how you use your device, even if the overall protection and services offered by the antiviruses are the same. We recommend Avast Mobile Security & Antivirus, AVG Mobile (smartphone and tablet) or Avira Antivirus Security. Don\u2019t forget that an antivirus that scans constantly will affect your battery life. You\u2019ll probably need to adjust how you use your device or at least make sure that your antivirus isn\u2019t too demanding. Don\u2019t hesitate to try out a few different antiviruses to see which one works best for you.\n\nHave you chosen to use an antivirus? If so, which one?

    "title": "By The Book: Renting a villa in Phuket",
    "text": "By The Book: Renting a villa in Phuket\n\nRenting villas is popular in resort areas such as Phuket and Koh Samui. Photo: Gazette file\n\nPHUKET: Renting a villa or apartment long term is very popular in Thailand, especially in resort areas such as Phuket, Pattaya, Hua Hin and Koh Samui.\n\n\n\nMany would-be buyers are deciding to hold off and rent for a year or more while they get to know the area and learn the ways of Thailand without so much risk.\n\n\n\nRenting long term is very cheap here compared to locations such as Europe, Singapore or Hong Kong. You can find a two-bedroom pool villa for as little as 35,000 baht (US$1,000) per month. The majority of rental properties are fully furnished and offer all usual amenities.\n\n\n\nUsing an Agent\n\n\n\nIt is highly recommended that you use a reputable real estate agent to ensure you get the right advice, property selection, assistance in viewings and negotiating the best rate possible. Going it alone is not advisable.\n\n\n\nRental Prices\n\n\n\nRental prices range from as little as 10,000 baht per month for a studio condo, to more than 400,000 baht for luxury high-end villas with stunning ocean views and staff to cook, clean and provide first-class service.\n\n\n\nThe average three-bedroom pool villa (sleeps 6) in a quiet area such as Rawai or Nai Harn, with lots of restaurants, bakeries, bars and shops nearby, and very close to the famous Nai Harn beach, go for 40-60,000 baht per month.\n\n\n\nRental terms and utilities\n\n\n\nA long term rental is usually one year, with some for as little as six months. This is, however, negotiable with the owner. The rental price includes \u0096 in most cases \u0096 maid service, pool cleaning and a gardener, but utilities such as electric, water, cable or satellite TV and internet are normally extra. You must check with your agent or owner at the outset to avoid disagreements later on.\n\n\n\nInternet\n\n\n\nMost villas and apartments have internet available, but not always broadband so you should check on the speed available if this is an important criteria for you.\n\n\n\nRental payment\n\n\n\nTypically rent is due on the first of each month in advance and must be paid to the owner's account as agreed at the time of booking. Failure to make payment on the due date or within seven days of the due date is grounds for immediate eviction. Some owners will agree a discount on the monthly rental price if a tenant is willing to pay six months or one year in advance.\n\n\n\nSecurity deposit\n\n\n\nThe owner will require a security deposit on booking, which is normally two months\u2019 rent, and is held by the owner until check-out. As long as all utilities and other bills have been paid and there is no damage to the property, then the deposit will be returned in full, usually within 21 days of departure. This delay is due to the owner waiting for utility bills to come through.\n\n\n\nInventory\n\n\n\nOn checking in, the owner should provide an inventory list for you to check, agree and sign.

    "title": "What was the defining color trend of smartphones in 2016?",
    "text": "Now that we've reached the end of the year, it's time to assess this year's design trends and make some predictions about what we might see in 2017. Shades of gold and glossy black made an appearance on some of the year's key devices, but across several manufacturers, the stand-out unique color for 2016 has to be blue. Take a look at the trends below and let us know what you think in the polls.\n\nBlue: the number one color trend of 2016\n\nIn my opinion, the defining color trend of smartphones in 2016 has to be blue. From the premium look of the blue Honor 8 to the fun and free shades of the S7 Edge and Pixel, it seems there was a unique blue smartphone for everyone in 2016.\n\nHuawei's Honor 8 has a slick, seamless design with thick glass covering the front screen and the aluminum alloy back surface, making each device color variation really shine. The premium-looking Sapphire Blue version has been one of the instantly recognizable, iconic phone designs of 2016.\n\nThe striking Sapphire Blue model of the Honor 8. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge's Blue Coral version just became available in the US recently, and it certainly stands out as more of a \"light and fun\" option than the more conventional colors the phone was offered in when it launched. The unique-looking Blue Coral model has a metallic, pastel blue back and bezel, with gold trim around the edges and on the side buttons.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge in Blue Coral / \u00a9 Samsung Singapore\n\nThe bright, vivid blue of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL makes the phone look more like a child's toy than an adult's tool. Since the \"not so serious\" color matches the blue of the company's logo, perhaps we could see a red, yellow or green Google smartphone in the future.\n\nThe bright, happy blue Pixel. / \u00a9 Google\n\nRunner-ups: the glossy black and gilded smartphones of 2016\n\nGold and shiny black also made a big appearance on the top smartphones of 2016.\n\nThe muted, elegant gold of the OnePlus 3T's aluminum alloy body is much more restrained than that of the much shinier glass-backed Galaxy S7, but both have a very premium look.\n\nOnePlus 3T - Soft Gold\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 - Gold Platinum\n\nThe muted, elegant gold of the OnePlus 3T. / \u00a9 OnePlus\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge's latest color was just announced a couple of weeks ago: Black Pearl. The glossy black exterior was no doubt inspired by the iPhone 7's Jet Black model, another iconic 2016 phone. The only drawback of these modern-looking glossy black phones is, of course, that they scratch easily.\n\nModern-looking glossy black phones like the S7 Edge in Black Pearl are a 2016 trend. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nWhat was defining color trend of smartphones in 2016? Blue\n\nGold\n\nGlossy Black (Only one selection allowed) View results VOTE!\n\nWhat could be the color trend of 2017?\n\nThe Huawei Mate 9 might give us a hint at 2017's potential color trend. The smartphone comes in the standard black, silver and gray options, plus refined-looking gold and white, and one surprise color: brown. This particular brown, Mocha Brown, is metallic and looks like a chocolatey version of the Champagne Gold model of the phone. Brown could be a warm, luxury look to become popular 2017.\n\nThe Huawei Mate 9's Mocha Brown is pictured in the middle. / \u00a9 Huawei\n\nAnother place we can look for interesting phone colors is the Moto G4. The online customizer for the phone, Moto Maker, offers several colors for the back of the G4 and G4 Plus, including bright blue, dark blue, dark wine purple, red, pink, pastel mint green, white, black and even real bamboo wood. So perhaps one of these colors will catch on next year.\n\nSince there was already a blue Google Pixel, maybe we'll see their other logo colors (red, yellow or green) on a Google smartphone someday.\n\nWhat will be the big smartphone color trend of 2017? Brown\n\nWhite\n\nGold\n\nOther (Only one selection allowed) View results VOTE!\n\nBlue hues, glossy black and muted gold seem to be the dominant color trends of 2016, and we hope to see more intriguing shades being released throughout 2017. In addition to design and color trends, Android has also pioneered trends like VR and dual cameras (Huawei P9 and LG V20).\n\nDo you like the direction trends were heading in 2016? What colors do you think will be iconic for next year's smartphones? Let us know in the comments!",

    "title": "L.A. steps up security measures during holiday season after Berlin market killings",
    "text": "Expect to see heightened security at Los Angeles shopping areas, farmers markets and other large gathering places in the coming days as authorities step up security measures in the wake of the Berlin Christmas market truck attack that killed 12 people this week.\n\nLos Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing said Tuesday that his counter-terrorism bureau has been aware for some time of the potential danger from attackers using trucks or other large vehicles to run down pedestrians.\n\nIn many places with heavy pedestrian traffic, concrete pillars are already in place to prevent someone from driving a truck onto the sidewalk. But, Downing said, additional barriers, including the use of large vehicles, can be deployed to block potential attackers from accessing open pedestrian areas.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to captains in precincts where there are large mass gatherings, be it farmers markets or shoppers,\u201d Downing said. \u201cWe are encouraging the use of vehicles and other barriers to protect the crowds.\u201d\n\nOther major law enforcement agencies are also taking extra precautions.\n\nScott Edson, chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s Homeland Security Division, said his department is planning additional security measures to protect crowds at large gatherings in the coming weeks and days, but declined to provide specifics.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is reminding everyone that one of the easiest ways to make a weapon of terror is to use a large truck or vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\nNew York police said Tuesday that they too were taking extra precautions to deter a truck attack. The agency said it has assigned additional officers to patrol potential targets, but did not provide specifics.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Berlin market attack through its Amaq news site, saying it had been carried out by an unidentified \u201csoldier.\u201d The language used suggested the attacker may have been inspired by the group but did not necessarily act on its orders. Police caught a 23-year-old man after the 40-ton truck careened through the crowd Monday, injuring 48 people in addition to causing the dozen deaths. But that man was released Tuesday.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Downing noted there was no specific credible threat of an attack planned for the holiday season, but encouraged members of the public to use the LAPD\u2019s iWatch app to make a report if they see suspicious activity.\n\nHeightened security in local areas often follows deadly terrorist attacks elsewhere. In the wake of last year\u2019s coordinated attacks in Paris that killed 130 people, security was increased at popular shopping areas and public transportation depots across Los Angeles County. Local authorities now view bus and railway stations, malls and event venues on par with the Rose Bowl and Dodger Stadium when it comes to risk assessment.\n\nTerrorism by truck has long been feared by law enforcement \u00bb\n\nExperts say installing barriers, closing off nearby access roads and adding armed security guards can act as a deterrent to attacks on so-called soft targets.\n\n\u201cWe can harden the target,\u201d Downing said.\n\nThe method used in this week\u2019s Berlin attack, he said, is not new but a reminder that something as ordinary as a truck can be turned into an instrument of terrorism in heavily populated areas without much security.\n\nThe danger first emerged in the 1980s with attacks in Lebanon using truck bombs. That concern was reinforced by the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which used a Ryder truck, and the 1993 World Trade Center attack in New York.\n\nJuly\u2019s attack in Nice, France, again illustrated the risks when a 19-ton truck plowed into a crowd assembled for a fireworks display, killing 86 people. And last month, an Ohio State student drove a car into a crowd at the university before attacking bystanders with a knife, injuring at least 11 people.\n\n\u201cNice, Ohio and now Berlin all show the danger,\u201d Downing said, noting that an Islamic State publication recently included a basic guide on using trucks to inflict mayhem and death.\n\nDowning said the LAPD is contacting local truck yards to ask proprietors to keep an eye on their vehicles to prevent thefts and to immediately report any suspicious activity.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be aware of their surroundings,\u201d he said.\n\nrichard.winton@latimes.com\n\nFollow @lacrimes on Twitter",

    "text": "New to Manchester and on its first UK tour, the full production of Billy Elliot has arrived at the Palace Theatre and if you haven\u2019t seen it before, you must.\n\nThis is technical, creative, passionate musical theatre at its most British and brilliant and showcases the talents of some the most hardworking young actors you will ever see.\n\nI don\u2019t normally wax quite so lyrical in a review, but then it is rare I genuinely run the gamut of emotions during a theatre production.\n\nAdvice: Wear waterproof mascara.\n\nHere the harsh realities of 1980s Britain are brought to human experience through the eyes of 12-year-old Billy Elliot, a motherless young boy brought up in a proud mining family, his dad and brother both out on strike in a community where Maggie Thatcher is the enemy incarnate.\n\nAgainst this dark backdrop of loss, financial hardship and political strife Billy finds he has a talent for ballet and the story follows from there.\n\nSo far so serious-sounding but don\u2019t be fooled, this show is as funny as it is poignant, filled with gags and the show utterly stolen by very small, very adorable-looking children uttering unexpected expletives and exploring very adult themes with maturity, wit and perfect timing in the broad tones of the working-class north east.\n\nIt is quite impossible to explain how good the children are in this production, set against the West End standard technical wizardry and creative, unexpected, staging and within an ensemble of extraordinarily talented, all-singing, dancing, performers.\n\nPlayed by the diminutive 13-year-old Lewis Smallman, one of four \u2018Billys\u2019 who rotate the role, Billy is on stage for almost the entire of this production, his repertoire of talent and stamina almost unbelievable as he dances, acts, sing and even performs acrobatics, his emotions brought to life through movement and the perfection of Elton John\u2019s rousing, touching, score.\n\nIt is the scenes between young Billy and his best friend the cross-dressing Michael (here played by the endearing Samuel Torpey from Manchester), both misfits, finding their way in a largely incredulous mining town, which leave you with high and lows.\n\nTogether with the young sexually forthright Debbie and the ballerinas of Mrs Wilkinson\u2019s class, their language is blue, their dance routines complex and wonderfully expressive as their find their way with mixture of naivete and knowing.\n\nMusically, this is wonderfully catchy, the audience emitting a gasp of anticipation as Billy begins the famous number \u2018Electricity\u2019 and technically it is incredible.\n\nThis production is, indeed, electric.\n\nFive stars.\n\n*Billy Elliot is at Manchester\u2019s Palace Theatre until January 28.",

    "title": "Designing the Perfect Office from Startup to Expansion",
    "text": "As we wind down 2016, make it one of your New Year's resolutions to think harder about how you set up your workplace. After all, the design of your office isn't just about aesthetics. In many industries, it's now key to your success.\n\nKeeping your workplace in line with current trends helps your current employees work more effectively. It helps you recruit future employees who appreciate a forward-thinking company. It can even help you land clients.\n\nFor start-up companies, a well-designed workplace is even more important. The office needs to be able to grow along with the company while also setting the tone for how things work early on.\n\nSo how do you do it? As president of a family-run office furniture company, I've been keeping tabs on workplace trends for years and put together a few tips on how to design the perfect start- up office.\n\nThese tips also apply to more established companies which are thinking of expanding in the next few years.\n\nEncourage Collaboration\n\nThe big trend of the past few years has been the open office, in which employers have taken down walls that artificially separated workers from each other. While this kind of workspace has drawbacks on privacy and noise, it makes it dramatically easier for people to collaborate.\n\nThe office of tomorrow will have even more spaces for collaboration. One corner might be a cozy couch and a bunch of comfortable stools that can be easily reconfigured to serve as an impromptu meeting place for a group brainstorm.\n\nGive Workers Privacy\n\nEven in a collaborative office, there are times when workers need privacy. A good option is to keep one office empty for use by people who need to call their doctors or spouses to discuss sensitive personal issues or for two workers to talk about a proposal or have an annual review.\n\nAnother option, if you have an open-office layout, is to design a space with seating that's designed both for collaboration and privacy. Some chairs now come with adjustable privacy screens that can let an individual worker isolate themselves to get work done or openly join a group discussion. Setting up small conference rooms with an easy-to-use reservation system can also help to create more private spaces in an open-office layout.\n\nThink Multipurpose\n\nThe office cafeteria is no longer just for eating. As one of the places where employees from different departments congregate, it's a crucial place for cross-team collaboration. Higher tables with integrated plugs and phone-charging USB outlets will help employees shift from an off- hand conversation into work, if inspiration strikes.\n\nThe same goes for chairs and couches throughout the office. All of them should come with integrated phone-charging and electrical outlets to allow them to serve as secondary workstations for people who just need a place to hunker down and get work done or get a fresh perspective..\n\nStay Flexible\n\nBusiness is constantly changing, so your office should too. The office needs to be able to expand--and, sad to say, sometimes even contract--as new products are launched, new divisions are added and client demands shift.\n\nWhen buying desks, look for ones that can be easily moved and configured in lots of different designs. At first, you might want workers in small groups of four, but as your business grows, you might need to arrange them in a more efficient rows. You shouldn't have to buy new furniture to do that.\n\nKeep Things Democratic\n\nAt more established businesses, hierarchies tend to harden. The corner office becomes a prized location for a key member of management, while newer employees get stuck in the office hinterlands.\n\nStart-ups can't afford this kind of rigidity. The next big idea for your firm could come from its newest employee, which management might not hear from a secluded corner office. Design your office to be as un-hierarchical as possible, with workers of all levels regularly interacting in an egalitarian way.\n\nOverall, the main objective for a new start-up is to be flexible. Just as your business strategy should be adaptive to the marketplace, your office infrastructure should also be able to change on a dime--and without spending too many dimes to do it.\n\nBlake Zalcberg is president of OFM, a family-run office and school furniture manufacturer and distributor headquartered in North Carolina with distribution centers there and in California, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Washington state.

    "text": "APPLES are one fruit that grows better in the UK than in anywhere else in the world.\n\nAnd yet only a third of apples eaten in Britain are actually grown here.\n\nAnd, although there are thousands of varieties, you're only likely to see four or five of those in the supermarket.\n\nLuckily we're pretty spoilt here in Oxfordshire as right on our doorstep \u2013 well, 7.5 miles out of the city centre \u2013 lies the wonderful Waterperry gardens and their five-acre orchard.\n\nThe team at Waterperry grow about fifty different varieties of apple, ranging from old favourites like Cox's Orange Pippin, Bramley and Egremont Russet to more unusual types like Ashmeads Kernel, Orleans Reinette and Kidd's Orange.\n\nIt's great for Cultivate to be able to stock something more unusual and I've had many of our customers tell me that they haven\u2019t had apples like the varieties we stock since they were a child.\n\nI even had one man return each Friday to buy up our entire stock as they were so tasty and evoked strong memories of his childhood.\n\nBut what I didn't learn until recently is that apple seeds, once planted, don't produce fruit that is identical to the apple they came from.\n\nThis is because they are what is called 'extreme heterozygotes'.\n\nRather than inheriting DNA from their parents to create a new apple, they are instead significantly different from their parents.\n\nThe only way to get a carbon copy of your favourite variety is to graft a budding branch from one tree onto the root stock of another.\n\nIt's essentially a form of cloning and apple growers have been doing this since the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nI must admit I'd been put off eating apples, having some rather disappointing ones from supermarkets in the past, but this year it\u2019s too tempting not to try the many varieties we get in from Waterperry each week.\n\nI'm currently enjoying the distinct yet delicate flavour of the Egremont Russets and plan on trying out some Cox\u2019s Orange Pippins next week.\n\nOnce I've found my favourite I\u2019ll be stocking up on the same variety of Waterperry apple juice to keep enjoying it well after the season ends.",

    "text": "Three city parks in Menlo Park are expected to see major improvements by springtime.\n\nJack Lyle Park and Willow Oaks Park are set to get restrooms, and Nealon Park and Willow Oaks will undergo dog park improvements, though Nealon\u2019s changes could come later. The changes come after a two-year refinement process that included several workshops for community input.\n\nSome of the support for changes was overwhelming. Nearly 400 people living near Jack Lyle responded to a 2014 survey of proposed changes, with 95 percent supporting and 4 percent against the addition of restrooms. That plan has been supported by the Rosener House, which is letting the city place the restrooms on its site, where bathroom plumbing is in place.\n\nDesigns for restrooms and a new dog park at Willow Oaks are underway, with a community open house and unveiling planned for January or February. The original idea of separating small and large dogs into separate enclosures was shot down by residents.\n\nThe city is expected to begin installation of an irrigation system for the sports field at Nealon this winter, followed by new sod in the spring. According to a staff report, the city is still determining a field closure schedule, as well as whether to find an alternative location for the dogs while the field is out of operation.\n\nChanges at Burgess Park are also anticipated. The Menlo Atherton Little League, which partners with the city on Burgess maintenance, is looking to improve the sports field by resurfacing the dugout, repairing tarps, building shade structures for the grandstands and adding a batting cage. The city will likely help fund the project, which is anticipated to cost between $97,000 and $162,500, but has not yet assigned any money.",

This report was published in Bloomberg, and it said that Google moved $15.5 billion to a Bermuda shell company. According to the report, this was revealed by regulatory filings in Netherlands. There are some loopholes among the US corporations where companies as big as Google are able to move the earnings through subsidiaries in countries which have a low tax rate (Ireland & Netherland) and then they can also move it to tax havens like Bermuda & the Cayman Islands.\n\nBloomberg reported that Google shifted profits to its subsidiary Google Netherlands Holdings BV, and then Bermuda mailbox. The total amount in 2015 was 40 percent greater than that of 2014. This is based on a report by Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad which published about the filings made by Google in Dutch Chamber of Commerce. According to the Bloomberg report, Alphabet which owns Google uses a subsidiary in Netherlands, which has no employees and has been using it since 2004. This type of tax structure is known as Double Irish or Dutch Sandwich. Technically, Google seems to be in compliance with tax laws in the countries it uses to lower the tax bills.\n\nAlso read | Google employee sues company for conducting \u2018spying program\u2019: report\n\nGoogle Ireland Limited, which is a collector of the company\u2019s advertising revenues, internationally, and around 12 billion euros came from here, which was funnelled through the Dutch company, while the remaining came from a subsidiary in Singapore that serves a similar role, Bloomberg reported. Bermuda has no corporate tax, where the money is finally transferred to. According to Alphabet\u2019s SEC filings Google has profited a whopping $58.3 billion earned through avoiding taxes in the US, Bloomberg reported. Ireland had stopped just a method this year, but companies who have been using this, are allowed at least till 2020.\n\nYou may also want to see:\n\nIt is unclear if this method will have any legal issues, but Google has been mired is some other controversies in recent times. A Google employee had sued the company for conducting \u2018spying program\u2019 and for being too confidential. Recently, in a technology summit with the US President -elect Donald Trump and many other leaders of top companies, the issue of corporate laws in the US was also reportedly raised. It remains to be seen what Trump can do to make these major companies remain and pay taxes in the same country.",

    "text": "In an age of remarkably divisive politics, even something as basic as clean air, land and water has become politicized. If we used the presidential election results as a proxy, half of the country apparently thinks that making \"America Great Again\" involves crushing the Environmental Protection Agency. And, the other half believes the exact opposite.\n\nPresident-elect Trump, let me suggest a way to get past this standoff. On the campaign trail, you said many things that you have since retracted or re-thought. You said you were going to aggressively pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton, make Mexico pay for a wall, ban Muslims and deport all illegal immigrants. You have since pivoted on all of these issues. Perhaps this same pragmatism and business sense will make you reconsider your promise to shut down the EPA as well.\n\nYou are businessman and I think we can agree that business is all about results. So before Scott Pruitt, your new EPA administrator, starts gutting his agency, let's look at it with a clear, business perspective: How does the EPA impact Americans' lives, their economy and their pocketbooks?\n\nThe facts may prove surprising.\n\n\n\nEPA programs have helped Americans become healthier and more productive\n\nSince President Nixon created the EPA in 1970, lakes and streams across America have been cleansed of pollution, rivers like the Cuyahoga do not catch fire due to spills, and our schools do not have to shut down daily because of polluted air. In the pre-EPA days, hazardous materials were disposed of, well, haphazardly. Today you are unlikely to discover that your new home is sitting on top of a toxic waste dump that makes you and your family terminally ill.\n\nUnlike the haze-infested air of the 1950's and 60's, a typical day in Los Angeles is clear and the sky is blue. It's easy to forget how horrible air quality was in American cities just 50 years ago, when smog shut down schools and factories. But, if you want an idea, look at recent photos of Beijing or Delhi. Just this week, Beijing and its surrounding cities had another pollution \"red alert\", shutting down 700 factories, power plants and restricting cars. \"The smog has serious repercussions on the lungs and the respiratory system, and it also influences the health of future generations, so under a red alert, it is safer to stay at home rather than go to school,\" said a young Chinese 15 year student, who had to stay home from school.\n\nNearly million people die prematurely every year from air pollution just in India and China. Without the EPA, those conditions could be found in New York or Los Angeles. Instead, America has a record of cleaning up air pollution unmatched around the world.\n\nA cleaner environment comes with huge public health benefits. For example, a 2010 study revealed that reductions in fine particle and ozone pollution avoided more than 160,000 premature deaths, 130,000 heart attacks, millions of cases of respiratory problems such as acute bronchitis and asthma attacks, and 86,000 hospital admissions. The reductions in air pollution prevented 13 million lost workdays, improving worker productivity, which contributes to a stronger economy. It also helped the next generation of workers, avoiding 3.2 million lost school days for kids due to respiratory illness.\n\nHealthier Americans are good for our nation.\n\nEPA standards are a bargain\n\nBusinessmen are always looking for a good return on investment. America's environmental protections are a steal. The public health benefits of a cleaner environment and a healthier workforce are far greater than the costs of achieving them. By 2020, for example, the benefits of enforcing the 1990 Clean Air Act will likely exceed compliance costs by a factor of 30 to 1. A recent 2013 study by the Office of Management and Budget that examined the cost benefits of EPA regulations over the last decade found that $45 billion in costs drove as much as $640 billion in benefits.\n\nYou may not be aware that the US has already acted in a significant way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that saves consumers trillions. A program which is improving fuel efficiency while reducing greenhouse gases also is already on the way to generating as much as $1.7 trillion savings for drivers based on an investment of around $150B by the automotive industry. Consumers have more money in their pockets while the planet is spared four billion tons of additional carbon dioxide.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are a politician, environmentalist or businessman: This is a win-win.\n\nEPA standards promote innovation\n\nBecause EPA protections create markets for new solutions, companies are encouraged to invest in groundbreaking technology from power plants, factories and cars.\n\nEven more impressive: this innovation has made America great. Our country is the world leader in production and consumption of environmental protection technology. In 2008, the environmental technologies and services industry supported 1.7 million jobs and generated $300 billion in revenues. And these jobs are typically high value and well paying - just what your supporters asked for on the campaign trail. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that demand for environmental engineers who already command an annual average $85K, will grow faster than the national average for all occupations between 2014 and 2024, increasing by 12 percent.\n\nSo, just how do these protections lead to innovation? Let's look at one of the earliest EPA successes, a 1970's vehicle emissions rule. The requirement that cars clean up their exhaust spurred a race between American corporations to develop effective, durable catalytic converters. America pioneered this technology; today it is found the world over. More recently, electronic fuel injection systems were developed to make cars more efficient and reliable. Gasoline direct injection (GDI) technology was used in less than 3% of cars in 2008 models. This year, the innovation will be found in half of all new cars. Environmental protections also prompted the development of powerful but compact turbocharged engines and silky smooth eight speed transmissions.\n\nThe EPA is playing an important role in the future of auto technology. Twenty years ago, barely anyone knew what a hybrid car was. As of last year, there were 76 alternative propulsion vehicle models available to consumers in the US market, from hybrids, plug in hybrids, battery electrics and even fuel cell vehicles. The affordable all-electric Chevrolet Bolt is the Motor Trend 2017 Car of the Year.\n\nAll of these innovations were the result of private industry know-how working to meet environmental standards.\n\n\n\nEPA programs makes American companies more competitive globally\n\nChina, already the world's biggest auto market, has also developed very stringent air pollution rules with the hope of cleaning up its poisonous air. Other nations are on very similar tracks. Between 2020 and 2025, China, Japan, the United States and Europe will all converge on largely common standards for automobile fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe EPA could begin the process of pulling the United States out of this group, but why? To be globally competitive, American automakers will still have to compete with Chinese and German companies, who are making huge investments in electric vehicles.\n\nThe story with stationary power - electricity - is similar. Last year, for the first time, the world added more energy from renewable sources than from fossil fuels. Today, the U.S. is number one in the world for wind energy production. Wind produced over 190 million megawatt-hours (MWh) in the U.S. last year - or 4.7 percent of the total electricity generated in the U.S - enough electricity for about 17.5 million typical U.S. homes.\n\nThat wind energy is produced in many of the states that voted for you. Iowa stands out with over 31 percent of its in-state electricity generation coming from wind energy. It is followed by Kansas and South Dakota who can account for 20 percent from wind, followed by Texas, Maine, Vermont, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Minnesota, Idaho, Colorado, and Oregon with 10 percent or more of their electricity from wind.\n\nMeanwhile, solar energy has closed the gap with wind energy earlier than expected. Nearly 30 percent of all new electric generating capacity in the U.S. in 2015 was solar, more than natural gas. This improvement was largely due to costs. Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports that that unsubsidized solar is beginning to outcompete coal and natural gas on a larger scale, per a survey across 58 countries including China, India, and Brazil\n\nIn fact, the report indicates that in less than 10 years, by 2027, the cost of running solar and wind plants will be less than existing coal and gas plants.\n\nEPA standards go hand in hand with economic growth\n\nThis is the best part. Between 1970, when President Nixon created the EPA, and 2011, emission of common air pollutants dropped by over a third. How did the economy do over that same time? Very well: US GDP grew 212% and total private sector jobs increased by 88%. Just as the space race fostered a whole generation of innovation, the race to save the environment is doing the same. Part of the reason for this phenomenon is that compliance costs don't go to the EPA - they go to other private companies that design, build, install and maintain the pollution reducing equipment.\n\nPresumably you will ask Scott Pruitt to gut the Clean Power Plan rule. Before you do that you may want to look what is already happening across the land. The U.S. solar industry now employs 77% more workers (209,000) than the U.S. coal mining industry does today (70,000) after adding over 35,000 jobs in 2015. By the end of this year, its ranks are expected to grow to 240,000 workers. Wind power supports 73,000 well-paying jobs across all 50 states. Nearly 20,000 American workers at over 500 factories across 43 states now build wind turbine parts and materials. The According to the DOE's Wind Vision report, wind energy jobs could grow to 380,000 by 2030 and supply 20% of the nation's electricity.\n\nThe tired claim that environmental protections hurt the economy is also undercut by the prosperity of California. With the sixth largest economy in the world, the Golden State has the most stringent environmental regulations and the most aggressive climate policies in the whole country - and, in some cases, the world. Yet its GDP has outpaced the country as a whole in recent years, in part because of a boost in green industries.\n\nSo, is every EPA program perfect? Of course not, there is always room for improvement. But, President Trump, investing in creating well-designed environmental protections is not just about making our air and water cleaner and our children healthier. It makes America's economy stronger. The EPA programs have delivered to date.\n\nThe next challenge in front of us is mitigating the worst impacts of climate change. US is a signatory to the Paris accords, which have no enforcement provisions but rely on peer pressure and public scrutiny. The Trump administration may feel itself immune to it all, but global companies do not. That could be the reason why some 350 US companies, from Intel to DuPont to Monsanto, all signed a pledge to support the Paris accords, and did so after your election.\n\nWhy? Because they know, once again, that technology-forcing environmental programs are good for business - and for America.",

She called her husband early Sunday and said she would be grabbing food on her way home. She never arrived.\n\nOn Tuesday, Los Angeles police detained Jackie Jerome Rogers for questioning and later placed him under arrest, according to LAPD spokesman Officer Tony Im. Rogers, 34, was a nursing student of Naegle\u2019s and the information he gave to investigators led them to believe she was murdered, Im said.\n\nHe was held in lieu of $2 million bail; it was unclear whether he had an attorney.\n\nLAPD officers, detectives and coroner officials seal off the 5000 block of 106th St. in Lennox after a body was found in a shallow grave.

About 2:30 a.m., Naegle called her husband, Derek Harryman, saying she was going to grab a bite to eat on her way home. He said his wife sounded drunk.\n\nBut the San Pedro resident never arrived home, her husband told the television station.

    "title": "Verna Knapp\u2019s Recipe Roundup",
    "text": "Verna Knapp\u2019s Recipe Roundup\n\nVerna Knapp tries one new recipe every week, which explains why she calls her kitchen a \u201claboratory for experimentation.\u201d She doesn\u2019t always create the dishes from scratch, but \u201cwhen I try a recipe I change the ingredients to see if I can improve it,\u201d she says. Her cookbook, My Recipe Roundup at the Knapp Ranch, contains a wide variety of foods. They include an uncomplicated \u201cBroiled Fish,\u201d a curiously different \u201cSauerkraut Apple Cake\u201d and an exotic \u201cEssence of Rose Ice Cream.\u201d Small ribbons placed beside a title designate prize winning recipes. There are 26 ribbons in the \u201cBread Basket\u201d section alone. Along with the recipes, Knapp added family and regional quotes and stories.\n\nKnapp has always been an avid recipe collector, but the suggestion to write a cookbook didn\u2019t come until the summer of 2003 when her youngest daughter vacationed at the Knapps\u2019 Waubay ranch and brought a computer. She said, \u201cHere, Mom, this is for you. Now you can write your cookbook.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did recall saying to her and our other daughter that I planned to copy my favorite recipes for them someday,\u201d Knapp says, \u201cbut I had no plans to learn to use a computer at age 80. My daughter said, \u2018Mom, you can do it.\u2019 Then she had to leave, but she showed me how to dial up and shut down.\u201d Knapp\u2019s progress was \u201cslow and painful,\u201d but through the winter of 2004-05 she organized and copied recipes using the computer. The following winter she completed the cookbook and sent it to a publisher.\n\nThe prize-winning ribbons in the cookbook might never have happened if it weren\u2019t for chicken pox. In the fall of 1957, Verna\u2019s husband became ill. They had three children at the time, including a three-month-old baby. \u201cI was milking and running the combine to harvest oats,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I hired two teenage girls from a little town west of here. They took turns staying with us and caring for the children.\u201d One of the girls came down with chicken pox and her mother didn\u2019t want her to come home because the father was quite elderly and ill with congestive heart failure. It was a big disappointment for the young girl; she\u2019d been working hard on a 4-H project for the Day County Fair.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a phone so I told her to write her mother and tell her that we would get her to the fair,\u201d Knapp says. \u201cShe wrote back, \u2018That\u2019s fine if Mrs. Knapp exhibits, but if she doesn\u2019t exhibit we can\u2019t expect that.\u2019\u201d Knapp had never intended to use her cooking skills to enter competitions \u2014 besides she was too busy with ranch work. But to console the young girl, Knapp said she would enter something. \u201cI whipped up some muffins to take. The results were great \u2014 the girls took top ribbons and I took top ribbon, too,\u201d she says. \u201cThat started me in competition. It was fun and a challenge, and I love a challenge.\u201d\n\nKnapp Ranch is 27 miles from Webster, 20 miles from Sisseton and three hours from Huron. Getting to a competition wasn\u2019t easy, but the distance wasn\u2019t the only obstacle for her. \u201cMy exhibiting was by chance. My main job was here at the ranch; if we weren\u2019t haying we were combining, if we weren\u2019t combining we were bringing hay home,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cMany times if I thought we had time to go, I would start after chores and bake until 1 or 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. That was fun.\u201d Knapp is a self-proclaimed bread-baker. \u201cI never run out of bread,\u201d she says. Maybe that\u2019s why it was her biggest winner. She won a year\u2019s supply of Red Star yeast, a year\u2019s supply of Robin Hood flour and three photographs to be taken by a photographer of her choice when her rye bread took top honors at the State Fair. \u201cOh my, I appreciated the prizes so,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just great!\u201d\n\nKnapp hasn\u2019t exhibited in many years, but she maintains an active lifestyle on the ranch. \u201cThis is my 64th garden on the same spot of ground,\u201d she says. She raises a variety of vegetables including two kinds of potatoes, two kinds of squash, a variety of salad greens, beets, carrots, and tomatoes. \u201cI\u2019m really retired, but I don\u2019t feel that way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve started selling produce at a farmer\u2019s market.\u201d Knapp also has several flowerbeds, including one that has roots in the long-gone claim shanty built in 1898 by her father-in-law and his brothers. The shanty\u2019s stone foundation forms a 24 x 24 foot \u201csunken garden\u201d that Knapp filled and surrounded with flowers.\n\nTo order Recipe Roundup at the Knapp Ranch, contact Verna Knapp at (605) 947-4309, or write 13168 450th Ave., Waubay, S.D., 57273-7500.\n\nVegetable Harvest Dish\n\n1 med. unpeeled eggplant, cubed\n\n1 med. unpeeled zucchini, diced\n\n1 cup chopped onion\n\n1 green pepper, seeded, diced\n\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1\u20444 cup olive oil\n\n2 large fresh tomatoes, peeled, cored, chopped\n\n1 tbsp fresh basil, chopped\n\n2 tbsps fresh sage, chopped, or 2 tsps rubbed sage\n\n2 tsps dried oregano, crumbled\n\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\n1\u20442 tsp nutmeg\n\n1\u20442 tsp allspice\n\n1\u20444 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)\n\n1 cup cottage cheese\n\n1\u20442 cup light cream\n\nSalt and pepper\n\nAfter cubing eggplant soak pieces in salted ice water.

    "title": "Riot Games reaches $300-million 'League of Legends' e-sports streaming deal with BAMTech",
    "text": "The gigantic broadcast rights deals that fueled an explosion in salaries for traditional athletes are making their first appearance in e-sports.\n\nOwners of \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d teams and the players on them stand to reap a significant chunk of a seven-year, $300-million media licensing deal announced Friday.\n\nNew York City technology firm BAMTech is paying the guaranteed sum to Los Angeles gamemaker Riot Games for the rights to distribute \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d matches in an app and across other services. BAMTech will attempt to make its money back \u2014 and more \u2014 through ads on the streams, though Riot Games will get an undisclosed portion of the profits.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the guarantees could escalate based on performance and whether payments will be made in equal or varying installments through 2023. The broad terms of the agreement were not announced, but confirmed by people close to the deal.\n\nRiot Games operates 13 tournaments for its game around the world, with weekly matches running most of the year followed by regional and international playoffs. About 100 million amateurs and professionals play \u201cLeague of Legends,\" with tens of millions regularly tuning in to watch the pros.\n\nStarting next year, matches will be broadcast on an app usable across devices. It will be a one-stop shop for data about \u201cLeague of Legends\" leagues. BAMTech also has the rights to include \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d videos in a multi-sport app the firm expects to launch next year. The app will roll out slowly across the world.\n\nBAMTech plans to work on reaching financial agreements with Twitch, YouTube and other video streaming services for them to simulcast matches and help broaden viewership. Twitch and YouTube have paid Riot Games a few million dollars for streaming rights in the past.\n\nHow lucrative the new deal will be for the young adults who dot rosters around the world could become known as early as next week when Riot Games officials meet with team executives. But the effects will almost certainly take at least a year to sink in. Owners of teams, including former Laker Shaquille O'Neal, longtime Hollywood executive Rob Moore and several European soccer teams, have entered e-sports in part because of the anticipated swelling of licensing fees.\n\n\u201cThis is a game changer for our sport,\u201d Riot Games e-sports directors Whalen Rozelle and Jarred Kennedy said in a statement. \u201cTrue economic sustainability is a critical means to ensuring a sport that lasts, and this represents a major step towards that goal.\u201d\n\nThe app is expected to be free to use, consistent with Riot Games\u2019 strategy of maximizing viewership. But it could make optional features exclusive to paying subscribers.\n\nBAMTech also handles streaming distribution for sports leagues PGA, NHL and WWE and media companies the Blaze and HBO. Major League Baseball holds a majority stake in the company, while Disney and NHL hold smaller stakes.\n\nSports media industry experts said last month that MLB could boost its own sport by using \"League of Legends\u201d to understand how millennials consume online content. Riot Games could find it easier to work with advertisers now that it has MLB\u2019s backing.\n\n\u201cWe think the world is ready for e-sports,\u201d Bob Bowman, MLB president for business, told Yahoo. \u201cThe sponsors are ready for it, dying for it. Every deal has a little bit of risk, but this is the best in the business and we always like partnering with the best in the business.\u201d\n\nparesh.dave@latimes.com / PGP\n\nTwitter: @peard33",

    "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 Three men have been charged in connection with a shootout police say left the 15-year-old daughter of Olympic sprinter Tyson Gay dead.\n\nTrinity Gay died at a Lexington, Kentucky, hospital Sunday after she was shot in the neck around 4 a.m. during an exchange of gunfire between people in two parked vehicles in the parking lot of a nearby Cook Out restaurant.\n\nDvonta Middlebrooks fired multiple shots during the incident, Lexington police investigators said Sunday. He was charged with wanton endangerment and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. A father and son were also charged Sunday. Chazerae Taylor, 38, and his 19-year-old son D\u2019Markeo both face wanton endangerment counts, police said in an online statement.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Brenna Angel said police don\u2019t believe Trinity Gay was in either of the vehicles involved.\n\nTyson Gay said he and his daughter were very close, according to Lexington TV station WLEX, which spoke to him Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so crazy. I have no idea what happened,\u201d Gay told the station.\n\nGrief counselors will be at Lexington\u2019s Lafayette High School on Monday for students and staff, Fayette County Public Schools spokeswoman Lisa Deffendall said. Both Gay and his daughter attended the school.\n\nTrinity Gay was a standout sprinter, placing in the top five in several events at the state championships in May. Her father still holds the state record in the 100 set in 2001.\n\nTyson Gay competed in the last three Summer Olympics. He was part of a team that won a silver medal in the 4\u00d7100-meter relay at the 2012 London Games though that medal was ultimately stripped after Gay tested positive for steroids in 2013.\n\nLast summer\u2019s Games in Rio featured another stinging disappointment for Gay, 33, who has battled injuries. He was a member of the American men\u2019s 4\u00d7100-meter relay team that finished third in the final before being disqualified for an illegal baton exchange between Mike Rodgers and Justin Gatlin. The team\u2019s appeal was denied, giving Canada the bronze medal.\n\nThe sports world has been mourning the news of the death on social media.\n\nUSA Track and Field tweeted, \u201cSending our thoughts & prayers to @TysonLGay & his loved ones as they mourn the tragic & senseless loss of his daughter, Trinity.\u201d Several of Gay\u2019s USA track teammates echoed the comment, including Natasha Hastings and Arman Hall.\n\nFormer NFL wide receiver Santonio Holmes, NBA veteran Vince Carter and tennis great Martina Navratilova have also tweeted messages of support for Gay.",

    "text": "As builders hammer away in the Peninsula\u2019s bayside cities in a concerted attempt to add housing units to address at least a small portion of the demand for new living spaces here, it\u2019s worth recalling that the original hotbed of San Mateo County development actually was on the Coastside.\n\nHard as that may be to believe today, the area south of what is now Pacifica was supposed to be the favored location for thousands of homes in the early years of the 20th century. And this massive effort was to be facilitated by an ambitious coastal rail line _ if they build it, they will come, as it were.\n\nCreation of the Ocean Shore Railroad, a risky venture in the best of times, was ticketed to be a boon for growth in what was then an isolated region accessible via two poor (and often dangerous) roads. The influence of the internal combustion engine had yet to become ubiquitous.\n\nThe railroad\u2019s owners had grand plans. They envisioned an electrified, two-track system running from a terminus in San Francisco all the way to Santa Cruz. Dozens of depots were on the drawing board. Construction commenced in 1905. The next year, the San Andreas Fault ruptured, causing severe damage to the the rail route\u2019s precarious cliffside section at Devil\u2019s Slide.\n\nWith cash running tight, work had to be scaled back to a one-track, steam locomotive setup but planning for major housing developments in places like El Granada, Farallone City (today\u2019s Montara), Naples, Venice Beach and Grand View Terrace proceeded apace.\n\nBut circumstances beyond the control of the rail visionaries were impeding progress. The advent of more and better vehicles was slowly impacting the railroad\u2019s bottom line. Home construction was very slow in the targeted hamlets.\n\nRail expenses were exceeding revenues in persistent fashion. The situation was not sustainable. The Ocean Shore line was never completed. Neither were the proposed coastal communities. The railroad went out of business in 1920.\n\nAfter that enterprise collapsed, any hope for a Coastside development boom evaporated. The focus shifted to growing bayside towns like Redwood City, San Mateo and Burlingame.\n\nIn today\u2019s construction climate here, the irony is that there is plenty of space available for new housing \u2014 again, south of Pacifica. But, with just a few modest exceptions, that semi-rural, coastal territory is off-limits now. Any hint of imposing significant development there is verboten.\n\nThe strong Peninsula environmental movement, in concert with the state\u2019s Coastal Commission, has made sure of that. So the default \u201canswer\u201d to our housing crunch (courtesy of the surging high tech/biotech economy in these parts) is to force new units to be built in \u201cstack-and-pack\u201d structures in bayside cities already faced with no end of congestion and other limitations.\n\nIf the old Ocean Shore Railroad had been a fiscal success and homebuyers could have been lured in large numbers to the dreamed-of coastal burgs on drawing boards a century or so ago, well, who knows what we might be looking at today.\n\nFor one thing, access to the Coastside would probably be a bit easier now, at least in theory. Highway 92 and Interstate 380 would be completed as designed. Highway 92 was to be extended all the way to Half Moon Bay and Interstate 380 would end up in Pacifica. Neither project was finished and it\u2019s doubtful they ever will be.\n\nAnd those aborted projects would be just the start.\n\nJohn Horgan\u2019s column appears weekly.

    "text": "Simple but savvy tips to help soften the chill this winter, making the season easier on you and your horses.\n\nBarrel racers by nature tend to pay meticulous attention to the care and conditioning of their horses, and wintertime is no time to slack off. Generally speaking, horses are built to live outside in comfort year round with few amenities provided by their owners. However, winter horse care requires attention to detail in areas such as nutrition, water, minerals, shelter and hoof care.\n\nHorses instinctively warm themselves up simply by moving around.\n\nChow down\n\nThe average horse needs to consume 2 percent of its body weight per day to maintain body condition, and the bulk of a horse\u2019s diet should come from forage, either hay or pasture. It is generally understood that some horses require less than 2 percent of their body weight per day in feed, especially if they are easy keepers, while others\u2014pregnant mares, working athletes, breeding stallions, older horses\u2014could require up to 3 percent of their body weight in feed per day.\n\nTerry Swanson, DVM, equine veterinarian and one of the founders of Littleton Large Equine Clinic in Littleton, Colorado, says winter nutrition is found mostly in hay.\n\n\u201cIt's really pretty basic. Horses produce more body heat from hay than they do grain,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cHorse owners think grain is a high-energy feed, which is true, but as far as creating a higher body temperature to keep the horse warm, fiber digestion is what ultimately keeps your horse warm.\"\n\nMake sure your horses have access to plenty of hay to help keep them warm on a cold day, and also keep in mind it is good to give them more hay on a cold night, or at least the choice to eat more.\n\nIf your horse is closed up in the barn and it's 40 degrees inside, it probably does not need three extra flakes of hay. Outside horses with a round bale often do not move much. They leave the round bale only to get water, so movement to keep warm does not occur much.\n\n\u201cIf you are observant, you will notice every now and then your horse will run around for no apparent reason, but the actual reason is to get warm. Eventually they make their way back to their groceries,\u201d Swanson said.\n\nIn addition to adding more forage to your horse\u2019s diet during the winter, Tom Wendel, DVM, of Wendel Veterinary Services in Penrose, Colo., says a horse in need of dental work will have a tougher time during the winter.\n\n\u201cGoing into the winter months, horse owners need to check their horse\u2019s teeth. If a horse has bad teeth and is not able to get all the necessary nutrients from their forage, the horse will lose weight and become thin,\u201d Wendel said.\n\nMake sure your horse, especially senior horses, have had their teeth floated on schedule before the cold sets in and make sure there are no sharp points present.\n\n\u201cHorses in the 15-year-old range will start to experience the degeneration process of their teeth, which will make some horses too uncomfortable to even drink water. The annual check-up of your horse\u2019s dental health is extremely important,\u201d Swanson said.\n\nWendel stresses horse owners know the condition of their horse\u2019s teeth before winter settles in. Although it may seem costly at the time, it will save your horse a lot of pain and your pocketbook a lot of cash in the end.\n\nThe art of blanketing\n\nThe million dollar question, to blanket or not to blanket, will probably never have a right or wrong answer, but whatever you decide to do, always put your horse\u2019s comfort first.\n\nA recent study conducted by Colorado State University suggests that blanketing horses is unnecessary. It states that horses have their own \u201cself-blanketing\u201d process that works like chill bumps do on human skin.\n\nHorses use energy to control their body temperature, which is why forage is so imperative during the winter, and movement will generate a considerable amount of heat. In addition, horses must always have a way to get out of the wind in order for their self-blanketing abilities to fully function.\n\nHowever, as some barrel racers tend to compete year round, it is a good idea to blanket your horses in order to keep them from getting chilled and cold after a hard workout.\n\n\u201cBlanketing depends on what you are doing with your horse,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cIf you are competing year round, keep your horses blanketed to keep the hair coat down so when it\u2019s time to cool your horse out, you are not dealing with chilled bodies.\u201d\n\nIn addition, horses that are clipped need to be blanketed, since the fluff is already taken off. If you have an older horse that gets chilled easier than other horses, a light blanket doesn't hurt.\n\nIf you blanket, remember a horse\u2019s hair coat fluffs out when it is cold. This adds air space like a down jacket, and that air fills with warmth, making the horse\u2019s natural coat more efficient. Blankets crush down that air space, so you need a heavy enough blanket to provide true warmth.\n\nIf you are unsure if your horse is warm enough, watch your horse\u2019s behavior. Horses that are cold tend to huddle up in a sheltered place together and may not be willing to move very far from the pack. Shivering may make it seem as if your horse is freezing, but shivering is actually a perfectly normal way to warm up. A warm horse may shiver for a short while when he is cold and still be happy.\n\nWet, cold weather is much harder on horses than dry cold. A rainy 35-degree day will cause a lot more shivering than any other weather condition. Damp, cold days like these are the time when horses really appreciate some sort of shelter to keep themselves even semi-dry.\n\nTrees and low places act as a natural wind barrier and can also provide some protection from precipitation. Ideally, a three-sided constructed shelter positioned to keep wind, snow and rain out provides the best protection from winter precipitation for pastured horses.\n\nWater and minerals\n\nWater is the most important part of any living being's diet. During the winter, it is extremely important to keep an eye on your horse\u2019s water availability and water intake.\n\nWith increased hay consumption, colic is more likely, especially if your horse is not drinking enough water. Make sure to check the horse\u2019s water source twice daily and remove all ice or provide a safe heated tank or bucket heater. Horses prefer to drink water that is slightly warm in the winter, and their water consumption typically increases if water is kept de-iced with an automatic de-icer, or manually.\n\nIn addition, continue to provide free-choice access to minerals, such as a salt block, throughout the winter. This should also increase your horse\u2019s water consumption.\n\n\u201cHorse owners need to be aware that all the same things go on in the winter that go on in the summer with what their horse\u2019s body needs,\" Swanson said. \"Ironically, if your horse is in the sunshine, supplements are not very critical. Their water consumption is the most important thing, especially in a horse that is working and getting hot and sweaty in the winter time.\"\n\nThe little things\n\nSmall details that may seem inconsequential can actually make a big difference in the equine mood during winter.\n\nWhen riding your horse during the winter, be sure to plan additional time for proper care both before and after rides.\n\nYour bit should be adequately warmed prior to riding to keep your horse comfortable.\n\nHorses that sweat during winter rides need to be dried out completely before they are put away or blanketed. A thick winter coat can hold moisture for a long time, and drying can be a very time-consuming task. A water-wicking cooler made of fleece or wool can easily be applied to your horse to draw the moisture out. Put your horse's cooler on to dry your horse before blanketing. Blanketing a wet, sweaty horse is a recipe for chilling him, which invites sickness.\n\nWinter conditioning\n\nWhen it comes to exercising our horses, we may feel like we are freezing our fingers and toes off, but cold does not bother our equine sidekicks as much.\n\nWinter conditions demand a little extra TLC to keep equine athletes healthy and happy.\n\n\u201cThe cold does not bother horses as much as humans,\" Swanson said. \"Their physiology is pretty remarkable to adapt to the heat during the summer and to the air and dry cold during the winter.\"\n\nConditioning your horses through the winter months is just fine.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to remember if you condition your horse throughout the winter is cooling your horse out when you are done working them,\" Swanson said. \"I cannot stress that enough. In addition, when trailering in the winter, do not close the trailer up tight; horses need fresh air circulating. If not, they are rebreathing the same humid air, which is higher in bacteria count. Keep the windows open, even if just the screen, and be sure to blanket if it's extremely cold.\"\n\nIcy tracks\n\nSome competitors prefer to pull their horses\u2019 shoes during the winter and give them a break. However, when demands of the show or rodeo season are year round, time off is sometimes not in the cards.\n\n\u201cI honestly think feet were better when they got a break during the winter, but nowadays with all the events throughout the year, a lot of people don\u2019t have another option,\u201d Colorado farrier Bill Clymer said. \u201cHorses' feet grow slower during the winter, but if horses are kept inside under lights, their feet don\u2019t change much. Outside, they tend to slow down a little. Some horses I have seen go seven to eight weeks without having to be reset. But the most important thing horse owners should remember is every horse is an individual.\"\n\nIn addition, horse owners need to pay attention to ice chunks that build up in horses' hooves,\u2014it will look like they are walking on high heels\u2014which is not good for their tendons, ligaments or muscles.\n\n\u201cIce chunks, or snow balls as I like to call them, need to be removed from your horse's hooves whenever they appear, or at least twice daily,\u201d Clymer said.\n\nClymer says the best way to avoid snowballs is to insert pads under your horse\u2019s shoes. The best way to remove snowballs is to tap the shoe with a hammer, and the snow will gently fall out.\n\nAbout Our Experts\n\nTerry Swanson, DVM, is a partner at Littleton Large Animal Clinic in Littleton, Colorado.

    "title": "Uber's self-driving cars put tech's 'move fast, break things' credo to the test",
    "text": "Uber became the dominant ride-hailing company in the U.S. by operating under the principle that it\u2019s better to ask for forgiveness than permission.\n\nIn city after city, the San Francisco company launched without first consulting local regulators, often in violation of rules governing taxi companies. As it grew popular, statewide bans were nearly always overturned and legislation crafted to legalize app-based ride-hailing services, helping Uber roll out in more than 45 states.\n\nNow, as Uber ventures into self-driving cars \u2014 with the long-term goal of having fleets of vehicles that don\u2019t require a driver behind the wheel \u2014 it appears to be embracing the same aggressive tactics. But what worked in Uber\u2019s war on taxis may not work in its war on drivers, according to technology and transportation analysts, who say regulators may prove less willing to cave now that the company is pushing technology that the public doesn\u2019t yet trust.\n\nOn Wednesday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles went after the ride-hailing giant, issuing a strongly worded letter demanding that Uber cease its self-driving car program in San Francisco or face legal action. The program \u2014 which uses Volvos equipped with self-driving technology but has a driver behind the wheel in case of emergency \u2014 launched in the city earlier that day. To complicate matters, one of the vehicles was caught on video running a red light (Uber blamed the incident on the error of its human driver).\n\n\u201cHad Uber obtained [a permit for testing autonomous vehicles] prior to today, the company\u2019s launch would have been permissible,\u201d Brian Soublet, the DMV\u2019s deputy director and chief counsel said in a letter addressed to Anthony Levandowski, the head of Uber\u2019s Advanced Technology center. \u201cHowever, it is illegal for the company to operate its self-driving vehicles on public roads until it receives an autonomous testing permit.\u201d\n\nUber had not responded to the DMV\u2019s letter as of Thursday afternoon, a DMV spokesman said, and the company did not immediately respond to The Times\u2019 multiple requests for comment. But on Uber\u2019s website, Levandowski said he didn\u2019t believe that the company needed permits, arguing that it was still \u201cearly days, and our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person monitoring them.\u201d\n\nMedia reports suggest that the vehicles remained on the road after the DMV sent its letter.\n\nThis attitude is typical of Uber, according to analysts, who noted that the company\u2019s familiar strategy of acting before asking \u2014 common among technology companies such as Facebook that pride themselves on \u201cmoving fast and breaking things\u201d \u2014 may face greater opposition in its push for self-driving cars than its upheaval of the taxi industry.\n\nOtto, a self-driving truck company that Uber acquired in August for $680 million, also landed in hot water with the Nevada DMV this year. The firm, which was founded by Levandowski, released a promotional video that appeared to show one of its trucks rolling down a highway without a person behind the wheel. Backchannel reported that the company did so even after the Nevada DMV issued a warning that it would be violating the state\u2019s autonomous vehicle regulations.\n\n\u201cUber has a history of playing pretty fast and loose with the rules,\u201d said Steve Beck, founder of business strategy firm cg42, which advises companies on ways to comply with regulation. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a strategy that works in this context because the stakes are really high.\u201d\n\nUnlike app-based ride-hailing, which consumers quickly warmed to because it met a desperate need in many cities for a more convenient and widely available alternative to taxis and limos, self-driving cars have not yet won in the court of public opinion.\n\nWhen companies are developing new technologies, it\u2019s incumbent on them to win over the public\u2019s trust, Beck said. And when it comes to self-driving cars, that trust simply is not there yet.\n\n\u201cAs a corporate citizen, this is a mistake for Uber,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThe stakes can literally be as high as life and death, and they\u2019re going to be seen as a company that\u2019s cutting corners. It\u2019s not a sound strategy.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the DMV\u2019s cease-and-desist order is state legislation that requires anyone testing autonomous vehicles on the state\u2019s roadways to apply for a permit. The permit costs $150 and requires holders to send reports to the state on crashes and on \u201cdisengagement\u201d \u2014 the times when the autonomous system turns off and hands control back to the driver.\n\nWithout a permit, Uber would not have to report such information. Permit holders in California include Tesla, Google, Honda, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and 15 other companies.\n\nUber might have a plausible legal argument, based on the text of the legislation, said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and a specialist in autonomous vehicle law. But the intent of the law, he said, is \u201cin large part about building trust, and Uber is not building any trust in its systems or practices by doing this.\u201d\n\nThe federal Department of Transportation this year issued proposed guidelines for autonomous vehicle development, explicitly stating that it believes the technology will lead to safer roads. Individual states, however, determine which vehicles can travel on their roads. Politicians and regulators are trying to balance life-saving innovation with protection of the public given the emerging technology\u2019s limited track record.\n\nLike all other states that have passed autonomous driving regulations, California defines \u201cautonomous technology\u201d as having the \u201ccapability\u201d to drive a vehicle with no human intervention. Uber claims that its cars are not autonomous and that there is always a driver inside. But it does call the cars \u201cself-driving.\u201d If the company is not being disingenuous, it is \u201cover-claiming\u201d the capabilities, Smith said. \u201cA human is turning the steering wheel.\u201d\n\nOr, as Evan Rawley, a professor at Columbia Business School, put it, \u201cThey want the cars to be considered self-driving by the investment community and human-driven by the regulatory community.\u201d",

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 price, release date, specs and rumors",
    "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are currently taking the smartphone world by storm. That said, shape is beginning to form around the Galaxy S8, which should appear in Spring of 2017. Here's everything else we know so far about the Galaxy S8 price, release date, specs and features. Hit the links below to jump straight to those topics or scroll down to learn more. The latest rumor is that the launch could be delayed until April, instead of in February at MWC .\n\nJump directly to:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: price and release date\n\nAmid the production halt of the Galaxy Note 7, a possible launch date for the Galaxy S8 was leaked by serial leaker Ricciolo. In a tweet, he claimed the unveiling will be February 26 at 7pm CET in Barcelona. This came from an 'Unpacked' photo in the tweet. You can view it below.\n\nThis is likely, since each year Samsung presents its latest Galaxy S line at Mobile World Congress. The Galaxy S devices are essentially the most important devices to be launched at a large and widely publicized tech conference. While the conference is in February, the market launch could begin in early April.\n\nAccording to a report from Naver, there's also a possibility the MWC tradition could be broken in 2017 and the unveiling could be in New York and delayed until April, to avoid rushing and causing any devastating mistakes with the S8 launch. This decision was the result of a global strategy meeting at the Korea HQ of the company, reportedly. If this is the case, it could be May until consumers can have the device in their hands.\n\nWe could see a release date around or during MWC 2017. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nThe price for the Samsung Galaxy S7 was up there with the priciest phones around. It currently sits at around $579 but started out in the $700 range for most vendors. Since the Galaxy S7 improved the specs of the S6, and the price reflected this, we could expect to see a similar price progression for the S8. This would be the natural course for Samsung to take, so their 2017 flagship might come with a price tag that breaks the $800 mark. While this would make this an expensive option Samsung has many devices to choose from, so you don't necessarily have to go with its flagship.\n\nOf course, that price tag is likely to vary around the world (as will the release date) and current rumors suggest that in India, for example, the Galaxy S8 will cost between Rs. 54,000 \u2013 Rs. 60,000. According to the somewhat spurious sounding GalaxyS8Info.com, it's due to go on sale in March, rather than April as had previously been reported. It's probably best to take information like this pricing and release date in India with a pinch of salt until a more trustworthy source has information to share.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 could improve upon the design of the S7. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: technical specifications\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: Camera\n\nAn insider leak from China says the S8 will be getting a dual camera. The primary rear camera will be 12 MP, and it will have a 13 MP secondary camera. With two sensors, you can create what is called a Bokeh effect, which will help with better depth of field effects. There will also be an 8 MP front camera for selfies, a welcome upgrade from the outdated fixed-focus 5 MP on the S6, S7 and Note 5. According to the Korean website ETNews, the front camera will have an auto-focus feature typical of rear cameras. Samsung has figured out a way to make it small enough to keep the camera from protruding from the phone, by mounting the actuator on the side of the lens rather than in the middle.\n\nAndroidPIT assessment: The rumors about the dual rear camera seem plausible, since there is stiff competition and the S8 will need to stand out.\n\nSources: SamMobile, SamMobile\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: Display and Design\n\nOverall design: The Note 7 may indicate what we could expect with the Galaxy S8. While the S7 made improvements to its design from its predecessor, it had similar specs to the Galaxy Note 5 that had been released six months before. And this follows previous releases of the Galaxy Note series, so the former Samsung phablet generation is usually a preview of the specs for the next Galaxy flagship.\n\nThe Note 7 foretells what might come with the Galaxy S8. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nThe Galaxy Note 7 more closely shares design DNA with the Galaxy S series, with the convergence of edges \u2013 whether large or small \u2013 across all Samsung flagships.\n\nEdge display: More purported details of the S8 have leaked, suggesting that the next phone in the range will have double-curved edges on the front and back, but that there will be no 'regular' model without a curved screen. There's even some suggestion that the screen sizes could jump to 6.2-inches for the larger model.\n\nThe Korea Herald wrote that Samsung planned to consolidate its flagship lineup, with next year's phones being honed down to curve-only displays. This could pave the way for a single Galaxy S8 edge device, the way the Galaxy S line was produced until the Galaxy S5. If this claim proves to be correct, it would mean a significant change for one of the world's most popular smartphone families. A change like this would signify that curved-edge displays had become the more popular choice for Samsung customers.\n\nRGB Super AMOLED Quad HD display: There are already rumors about a 4K display, or a Bezel-less OLED display, but the latest rumor is that the Galaxy S8 will be getting an RGB Super AMOLED Quad HD display. According to SamMobile, Samsung is planning to ditch the Diamond PenTile pixel arrangement for one with sharper image quality. An RGB arrangement will bring around 11 million pixels, while the old layout was only around 7.3 million. This will make a profound difference for VR applications.\n\nBezel-less OLED display: The Korean Herald spoke to a Samsung Display researcher who said \u201cSamsung Display would roll out a full-screen display whose display area ratio [...] reaches more than 90 percent next year\u201d. The Samsung employee declined to officially confirm this full-screen adoption but there are reports that Apple is working on implementing this technology into its iPhone 8.\n\nIt's possible that the Galaxy S8 makes strides in its display technology. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nForce touch: According to industry sources, Samsung is considering putting pressure sensitive technology in the Galaxy S8. The technology, also known as Force Touch or 3D Touch, allows software to react to different levels of pressure being applied to the screen with a finger. For example, it can allow pressure to be used to adjust a brightness setting or zoom in on a photo. An anonymous Samsung supplier said, \"Samsung is considering adopting the force touch technology partially from the S8 but the full adoption will come in one or two years \u2026 It is a matter of time before other major Android smartphone makers deploy the technology that will help enhance user interface.\" This implies that while the S8 edge may have the hardware technology ready to implement, full software integration could take up to one or two years. Phones that are already using this technology include the iPhone 6s and the Huawei Mate S.\n\nFingerprint scanner on the back: The S8 will likely leave the home button behind, which could have made it the first smartphone with an optical fingerprint sensor under the display. This isn't expected, though. Synaptics, which has long been the supplier for Samsung's fingerprint scanners, has just announced the release of its Natural ID optical-based fingerprint sensors for smartphones and tablets, which are due to go into mass production in Q2 2017. This will be too late to make it into the S8 before launch, which is why it's not likely to get an optical fingerprint scanner.\n\nWhat will it get if not a home button or an optical fingerprint scanner? A scanner on the back, of course. A new report says that Samsung will place the fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, much like the Google Pixel. Samsung hasn't confirmed anything yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.\n\nAndroidPIT assessment: There's a lot of contradictory information floating around with regard to the display size, a frameless design, and the possibility of only having an Edge variant. The facts remain to be seen, and all we can do is speculate at this time.\n\nSources: The Investor, Weibo, Weibo, Weibo\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: Audio\n\nSamMobile has confirmed that the Galaxy S8 will not have a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack. And like the iPhone 7, the USB Type-C port will be used instead, meaning you won't be able to charge your phone while using headphones and you'll need an adapter for any headphones you already own.\n\nThere is another rumor from Fonearena about the S8 getting stereo speakers, but this is far less likely. Samsung took over Harman Audio, but they said themselves that Harman Audio coming to the Galaxy S Series was just a thought for 2018.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: Processor, RAM, and other\n\nProcessor: The S8 edge could bring smartphone performance to even greater heights with two chipsets. Half of the Galaxy S8 devices could be packing a Snapdragon 830 or a Snapdragon 835 processor while the others might come with the Exynos 8895 that was previously rumored. This comes as no surprise as producing devices with different chipsets is nothing new for the Korean smartphone giant.\n\nThis information comes to us via etnews in Korea in a story that also speculates that the processor could be made with a new Samsung 10nm process. If the Exynos 8895 is made with the same 10nm process then the differences between the two might be minimal \u2013 just like last year.\n\nWhich processor will we see in the Galaxy S8? / \u00a9 Qualcomm\n\nThe Exynos 8895 processor, which is said to be capable of up to 4 GHz speeds, might be used in some of the Galaxy S8 smartphones. The rumored Exynos 8895 would provide an estimated 30 percent performance improvement on the Exynos 8890 found in the Galaxy S7 (in some regions) if the claims are accurate. The chipset makes use of ARM's newest Mali-G71 GPU, which is rumored to be 1.8 times faster than the Mali-T880 MP12 GPU found in the Galaxy S7.\n\nSammobile reports that an executive from Samsung was arrested by South Korean police for attempting to steal company information about the S8's newest chipset. The arrest report might have revealed the 10-core processor Samsung will be using in its upcoming flagship next year.\n\nRAM and internal storage: According to information posted on Chinese social network Weibo, the Galaxy S8 will reportedly deliver a 5.5-inch 4K display geared for VR and will come with a whopping 6 GB of RAM. Leaks from China via SamMobile also suggest it could come with up to 256 GB of internal storage, and the leaks corroborate the 6 GB RAM claim.\n\nBattery: The Note 7 battery doomed the phablet and put the South Korean smartphone giant in jeopardy. We can expect that Samsung will pull out all the stops to ensure that the Galaxy S8 goes off without a hitch. So it came as no surprise to us that the company could be looking externally for help with the S8 battery. The Korea Herald reported that a Samsung executive said that the company is \"looking at diverse suppliers, including LG Chem\" for help with the Galaxy S8 battery. This has not been confirmed by either company, but there are sources who say a deal has already signed between the two. This would not be the first time that Samsung looked to LG for partnership.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 came with a 3,000 mAh battery. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nAndroidPIT assessment: The Galaxy S8 will definitely have high-end hardware and impressive performance, but it remains to be seen if it will have the Snapdragon 835, 830 or the Exynos 8895 processor. It is likely that it will have 6 GB of RAM though.\n\nSources: SamMobile, Weibo, Weibo, Techtastic\n\nRumored specs at a glance\n\nThe Galaxy S8 is rumored to have the following specs, which include the latest version of Android and the also rumored Snapdragon 835 processor:\n\nSpecifications Galaxy S8 Specs Type Phone Model SM-G950 Manufacturer Samsung Dimensions 145 x 72 x 6 mm Weight 171 g Battery Size 4,200 mAh Screen Size 5.1 inches Display Technology AMOLED Screen 1,440 x 2,560 pixels (576 ppi) Front Camera 9 MP Rear Camera 30 MP Flashlight LED Android Version Android 7.0 Nougat User Interface TouchWiz RAM 6 GB or 8 GB Internal Storage 64 GB, 128 GB Removable Storage up to 256 GB per slot (single and dual SIM models) Chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 or 835 Number of Cores 8 Max Clock Speed 3 GHz Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, USB 3.1\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: features\n\nSo far, speculations about the features of the Galaxy S8 have had a futuristic note about them. Of course, the Galaxy S7 also had some cool features, like waterproofing. The Samsung S7 Active took its durability a step further. We hope to see the 'shatter-resistant' display on the Active in the Galaxy S8, among other things.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: Bixby digital assistant\n\nThe S8 will likely come pre-installed with a digital assistant, Samsung's new equivalent of Siri, named Bixby. But, Bixby differs from other AI helpers in that it will be a third-party open platform. Bixby will run on many devices, like appliances and wearables, and become the control hub for your smart home. Recently acquired Viv Labs, Inc. and Samsung both agree that AI assistants are the next major revolution in IT. Samsung may even add a special button to the phone to activate Bixby.\n\nAndroidPIT assessment: Samsung wants to get in the AI assistant game with Apple and Microsoft, and build a platform out of it. Bixby could end up a flop if it doesn't get any unique features.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: iris scanner\n\nThe S8 will likely feature an iris scanner. The Note 7 was released with one, and it would be a shame to let the feature end there. The iris scanner offers an extra level of security which can't be faked, and an API would allow third party apps to use the iris scanner as a way for users to unlock sensitive files.\n\nAndroidPIT assessment: the iris scanner is a done deal. Whether or not people need it is another story.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: goodbye mechanical home button, hello subscreen sensor\n\nFor many years, Samsung has stood by hardware buttons in its design, though Android has moved on to using virtual buttons. With the Galaxy S8, we could see a change. Samsung just filed a patent application to recognize swipes on the home button. Then you could maybe launch apps by swiping left or right on the home button. It's not clear whether there will be a mechanical button or not on the S8, as Samsung has not yet chosen a supplier for a button.\n\nAndroidPIT assessment: Apple has said goodbye to the mechanical button, and Samsung is expected to follow suit.\n\nSource: Weibo\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: a high-resolution Daydream\n\nGoogle announced at its I/O developers' conference earlier this year that Android Nougat will come with VR support installed in the OS. This platform is called Daydream, and for devices to support it, they have to meet a certain specs sheet defined by Google.\n\nWhile these specs have not yet been made public, several devices have already been confirmed or even released that are certified Daydream-ready. Among these devices is the Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe, which has a Full HD display, suggesting this to be the minimum requirement on the display front.\n\nHowever, the latest Galaxy S8 edge rumor, coming via phoneArena.com, suggests that Samsung wishes to future-proof the device by equipping it with a 4K display. Indeed, the rumored code name for the Galaxy S8 project \u2013 Project Dream \u2013 points flirtatiously towards Daydream, so a focus on VR does not seem at all unlikely.\n\nCould the Galaxy S8 be optimized for Daydream? / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nSamsung also recently showcased a 5.5-inch 4K display, suggesting serious headway is being made towards placing such a display inside the next generation of the Galaxy S series.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8: heartbeat-measuring laser\n\nAn interesting feature that could accompany the Galaxy S8 is a new laser dedicated to measuring the heart rate through the skin. This came to us via SamMobile from a patent they spotted. The device would perceive the pulsation of the arteries and determine your pulse. You can see the patent below.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 / \u00a9 Patently Mobile\n\nThe camera system of the Galaxy S8 could incorporate the iris scanner from the Note 7. This came to us from The Korea Herald, who reportedly spoke to a Samsung official on the condition of anonymity. This source claimed that \"Samsung never uses the same camera for its flagship models [...] so there surely will be an improvement\" for the S8 camera.\n\nThe official also claimed a dual-lens camera \u2013 technology we've seen in other high-end flagships this year \u2013 could accompany the S8. He didn't indicate whether there will be a different camera system for the rumored variants. We do hope that the S8 won't incorporate too many features from the Note 7.\n\nAnother rumor we have for the camera of the S8 is from PhotoRumors. They say the phone could come with a CMOS sensor 1/1.7-inch aperture that could come with a resolution between 18 to 24 MP.\n\nSamsung Galaxy 8: concept designs\n\nWe hope to see big changes with the Galaxy S8, and we're not the only ones. The designer Steel Drake threw his hat into the ring for designing the new flagship device and we hope to see some of these in 2017. We've seen some interesting design concepts for the S8 already but we desperately want these.\n\nDesign concepts for the Galaxy S8. / \u00a9 Steel Drake\n\nAs you can see, the front would have the Samsung logo at the bottom along with the front camera at the top. Missing is the physical home button and fingerprint reader. This makes the screen take up far more of the front of the device and a welcome look for those wanting a better screen experience.\n\nTo us, the back of the device in the design renders are equally interesting. The back has a brushed steel look. This would be a complete change from the Gorilla Glass back on the Galaxy S7. At the top of the device Steel Drake also included a projector, which is interesting but probably not practical for a smartphone as it could be too taxing on the battery.\n\nThe projector in a concept design. / \u00a9 Steel Drake\n\nWhat are you hoping to see from the Galaxy S8? Let us know in the comments.",

    "text": "Noodles & Strudels for the Soul\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story is revised from the November/December 2012 issue of South Dakota Magazine. To order a copy or to subscribe, call (800) 456-5117.\n\nA man sporting a thick salt and pepper beard eyed me suspiciously from his slowly passing pickup as I approached the back door of the Dakota Cafe. It was shortly after 10 a.m. on a Monday morning, and we both knew the cafe hadn\u2019t yet opened, but owner Cris Mayer had assured me I would find the key in the door.\n\nThe Dakota Cafe in Hosmer was my first stop on a journey exploring South Dakota\u2019s rich heritage of German cuisine. In two days of eating my way through McPherson and Edmunds counties \u2014 two of the most German-rich counties in South Dakota \u2014 I\u2019d consumed German noodles, cheese buttons, strudels, dumplings, kuchen and sausage that is fried in kitchens from coast to coast. Had my trip simply been about discovering delicious ethnic food, it was a resounding success. But it also became a fascinating journey through hundreds of years of American and European history, tracing how Germans from Russia were forced to cut ties with their homeland twice, and how the food served in several South Dakota restaurants helps descendants retain their cultural identity.\n\nHosmer and Eureka are decidedly German communities in a predominantly German state. The federal government stopped asking census respondents about their ethnic heritage in 2010, but in 2000 over 40 percent of South Dakotans claimed a German background, the largest ethnicity reported. Out of 208 people surveyed in Hosmer, 141 (78.8 percent) indicated German heritage and 51 (28.5 percent) marked Russian. In Eureka, 706 of its 868 residents claimed German lineage and 207 said Russian. Listen closely and you\u2019ll still hear a slight German brogue among locals.\n\nSo it might have been easy for Dan and Cris Mayer to feel out of place when they moved to Hosmer in 2000. The Mayers had earned a living revamping restaurants in Scandinavian-rich Minnesota and sought a change of scenery. They attended an auction in North Dakota and learned the following day that their $1,000 bid had purchased a house in Hosmer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we bid on,\u201d Cris Mayer says. \u201cIt was a huge leap of faith.\u201d\n\nA higher power may indeed have been involved. The city of Hosmer had built a restaurant in 1994, but it lacked consistent ownership. The Mayers, with their extensive restaurant background, bought the business and have been making meals ever since.\n\nThe Mayers are admittedly comfortable cooking standard restaurant fare, but the town\u2019s German citizenry had grown accustomed to eating a traditional ethnic meal once a week. German cooking was a foreign concept, so they turned to Ruth Schumacher, a Hosmer native who grew up on a farm learning recipes for strudels, dumplings, cheese buttons and hot potato salad from her mother.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed helping my mother any chance I could,\u201d Schumacher says. She discovered as a child how seriously her mother treated cooking.\n\n\u201cMy mother was very particular about when her bread rose, and when it was time to go into the oven,\u201d she recalls. \u201cMy brother was mischievous anyway. The bread was ready to put in oven and he pinched it and it flopped down. Mother happened to come in the kitchen. My brother was fast, but mother caught me and I got a spanking. I always said it wasn\u2019t my fault, and I blamed my brother until his dying day.\u201d\n\nSchumacher taught at a rural school and in Hosmer for 43 years, all while retaining the German recipes she had learned. When her granddaughter began waitressing for the Mayers, she bragged about the German food Schumacher made. The cafe owners invited her to help on Tuesdays. Now she helps plan the weekly meal and keeps track of what is served.\n\nSchumacher was busily preparing batches of cheese buttons on the day I visited. \u201cYou can boil them or you can fry them, just a couple of minutes,\u201d she says, carefully placing a spoonful of dry cottage cheese mixture onto the dough, and folding it into a tiny pocket.\n\nOn the east side of the restaurant, box fans on full blast were busily drying piles of German noodles produced by M.A.\u2019s Noodla, Hosmer\u2019s noodle company. Long, flat pieces of dough are run through a machine that produces strings of noodles that can be cooked in soups and dozens of other German dishes. M.A.\u2019s makes 19 varieties that are sold in nearly 30 grocery stores.\n\nHosmer\u2019s Noodle Company had been in business since 1987 when the Mayers and Hosmer resident Sarah Aman bought it in July and moved its operations to the cafe. A portion of the restaurant is blocked off once a week so the noodlers can work. \u201cNoodling was big for the Germans of this area,\u201d Mayer says. \u201cThey noodled when they first arrived here as pioneers. They\u2019d cut them out and lay them over their cupboards to dry.\u201d\n\nDough foods like noodles, strudels and dumplings are staples of the German diet. They require years to perfect, as I discovered when I met the strudel queen of McPherson County. Vicki Lapka makes a variety of German foods, but she\u2019s the person everyone in Eureka seeks when looking for strudels. We visited her restaurant, the Lyric Lanes, on a Tuesday morning as she prepared her weekly German meal.\n\nLapka, a fifth-generation descendant of Germans from Russia, learned strudels and other German delicacies from her grandmother while growing up around Mound City. But after high school she and her husband moved to the Twin Cities, and those German recipes lay dormant for 15 years. In January 1992 they moved back to Eureka, bought the Lyric, and inherited its Saturday night German buffet. Lapka\u2019s mother helped her relearn German cooking, and the weekly German meal, now on Tuesday afternoons, has remained a tradition.\n\nMeals include sausage, dumplings, pigs in a blanket or knoepfle soup, but Lapka\u2019s specialty is strudels. It was one of the first recipes she learned, and years of practice have made her an expert. Three electric skillets sat atop her counter when I arrived. She added water, lard, onions and potatoes, then set strudels on top and closed the lid. \u201cIf you open them while they\u2019re cooking they just drop,\u201d Lapka explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have flat dumplings and flat strudels. My kids learned the hard way. If I was making dumplings or strudels, they stayed out of the kitchen.\u201d\n\nStrudels are a temperamental food. If the water is just a few degrees too cool or too hot, the yeast won\u2019t react correctly. And of course they must remain covered. Since Lapka can\u2019t see them cook, she tips the pan after 30 minutes of cooking and listens to see if they are frying inside. If there\u2019s no sizzle, she knows they need more time. Before I left, Lapka showed me freezers packed with 150 pounds of strudels to fill orders from townspeople.\n\nThe foods I sampled in Hosmer and Eureka have been staples of the German diet for centuries, and became part of the South Dakota culinary scene because of events that began unfolding in Europe nearly 250 years ago. Eighteenth century Germany was embroiled in near constant war and home to a state religion that all citizens were required to practice. In 1763, German-born Russian empress Catherine the Great extended an olive branch to her people: she offered freedom from military service and 162 acres of land near the Black and Caspian seas.\n\nNearly 40,000 Germans relocated over the next century, settling in the Volga River valley and the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. They lived in tightly knit pockets, practicing their own religion, making their food and observing other social customs. Their successful farming practices transformed southern Russia into the region\u2019s breadbasket. But in 1871, Czar Alexander II revoked Catherine\u2019s edict. Once again, the Germans sought a new homeland.\n\nAt the same time, promoters in Dakota Territory were busily recruiting homesteaders to settle the land many Americans derisively called the Great American Desert. Land agents, aware of the Germans\u2019 plight, sent literature to the Russian steppes, hoping to lure the farmers across the ocean. The Germans were intrigued by the Dakota proposition and sent five men to Yankton in 1873 to scout settlement locations.\n\nThus began the great German migration, which coincided with the Dakota Boom years of 1878 to 1887. In 1880, there were 81,781 people in Dakota Territory. By 1890 the population had swelled to 328,808. Many Schwartzmeerdeutsche, or Black Sea Germans, settled in what became known as the German Russian Triangle of southeastern North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota, especially McPherson County. Another pocket emerged around Freeman and Menno in Hutchinson County. \u201cWe were the original draft dodgers,\u201d explained Sally Roesch Wagner\u2019s uncle John in Wagner\u2019s Daughters of Dakota series.\n\nWagner\u2019s ancestors left their home in Glueckstahl for a new life in America. Like other German families who endured similar relocations, one comforting constant was food. Wagner wrote that her grandmother\u2019s life remained centered around German cuisine. \u201cGrandma cooked like she had in the old country,\u201d Wagner wrote. \u201cHalupsi, or pigs in a blanket as we called the rice, hamburger, cream and tomato wrapped in a cabbage leaf she made for us.\u201d Other German dishes included hot potato salad, a deep red beet soup called borscht, wine soup, kuechla and kuchen, \u201cthe bread dough with a fruit and custard filling that some call a cake and others a pie.\u201d\n\nFood has remained a constant comfort for South Dakota\u2019s Germans in a way that\u2019s unmatched among descendants of other European homesteaders. \u201cNationalities still are associated with cuisines, but the interest in preserving these associations by eating specific foods everyday may vary widely,\u201d wrote Gregory Mader in his master\u2019s thesis on ethnic food in the Upper Midwest. Norwegians continue their traditional lutefisk feeds during winter months. Danes make pancake balls called aebleskiver every summer at Viborg\u2019s Danish Days. And the Dalesburg Midsommar Festival features a Scandinavian smorgasbord annually on the summer solstice. But you can find a traditional German meal in cafes across South Dakota every week throughout the year.\n\nThe tiny town of Tolstoy in Potter County was without a cafe until Brad and Joletta Naef arrived in 2009. The Naefs had careers in California, but they retired to the town of 36 people and opened Dakota Jo\u2019s Cafe in the old post office. On Thursdays the Naefs serve a German buffet with dishes Joletta learned to make while growing up on a farm five miles northeast of Tolstoy. Favorites include halupii (a cabbage roll with rice, hamburger and tomato), cheese buttons, spaetzle with German sausage, fleisch kuchle and a pumpkin-filled pastry called plachinda. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a group of ladies who leave sad if we\u2019ve run out of knoepfle soup,\u201d Naef says.\n\nThe Main Street Cafe in Bowdle serves German food on Thursdays and stages a grand German buffet the first Sunday of the month. Farther south, Rita Hoff responded to the demands of Menno\u2019s citizenry and began serving German food on Tuesdays. Another delicacy with German origins is chislic, a local favorite served anytime at Papa\u2019s in Freeman or Meridian Corner, at the junction of highways 18 and 81 halfway between Freeman and Yankton. The skewered mutton arrived in Hutchinson County with John Hoellwarth, a German immigrant from Russia. Papa\u2019s serves 3, 6, 9 or 12 sticks either deep fat fried or grilled with lemon pepper, garlic pepper, barbeque or plain. Meridian Corner offers chislic with garlic salt or a special Greek seasoning.\n\nAll the German food served in cafes is homemade, including the sausage, which most likely comes from the local meat market. Gerard Heier and Larry Kauk may not realize it, but they are among the most respected members of the German food culture hierarchy. \u201cGermans developed butchering and sausage making into a fine art,\u201d wrote Rose Marie Gueldner in her book, German Food and Folkways. \u201cEven after the wane of farm butchering in the last half of the 1900s, the reputation of the German Metzger and Wurstmeister was carried on by individuals doing custom butchering and small town grocers making and selling sausage. During settlement and succeeding decades most country people had no reason to patronize the town\u2019s meat market except to occasionally buy several rings, sticks or links of sausage from a butcher so esteemed in the craft that his name and products were spoken with a certain reverence.\u201d\n\nMeat is king in German cuisine, and pork is the star. German families chose to butcher hogs because cows produced milk and far more meat than a family could consume before spoilage. With hogs, families could \u201cuse everything but the squeal,\u201d Gueldner wrote. Butchers carved hams, roasts, bacon and sausage. Hog fat became lard, and the intestines provided perfect casings for specialty sausages.\n\nHeier and Kauk both come from butchering families. Heier\u2019s ancestors followed the Germany-to-Russia-to-South Dakota route, disembarking the train in Hosmer and homesteading six miles northwest of town. His father, Joseph, opened Heier\u2019s Meat Market one block off Hosmer\u2019s main street in 1966 using his grandfather\u2019s locally famous sausage recipe.\n\nHeier began working in the locker at age 10, but he left Hosmer to work as a computer technician in Rapid City. He returned in 1981 to take over the meat market after his father died. He and his brother, David, have tinkered with the family recipe, and their sausage remains so popular that they make 100,000 pounds every year. \u201cWe\u2019ll sell the spices, but we won\u2019t give out the recipe,\u201d Heier says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of calls from people who want to know, but we won\u2019t give it out.\u201d\n\nOther wurstmeisters follow the tenets of sausage secrecy, but not Larry Kauk. Both of Kauk\u2019s grandfathers were butchers, and he learned the trade on the family farm near Artas. In 1982 he built a huge locker and processing facility on the north side of Eureka along Highway 47. Kauk\u2019s meat market produces hams, steaks, brats, but their signature item is fry sausage. They ship hundreds of pounds of fry sausage to McPherson County expatriates from coast to coast.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no secret to it,\u201d Kauk says, matter-of-factly. \u201cWe make it the way the old Germans did in the old days. You take good, fresh pork meat and add salt, pepper and garlic. I\u2019m sorry if you were looking for some big surprise. The people who used to make it years ago are all in the grave, so that\u2019s why I keep doing it. That\u2019s what I hear all the time. \u2018Dad used to make that and now we can\u2019t find it anymore.\u2019 So we\u2019re not doing anything different.\u201d\n\nStill, people can\u2019t seem to replicate Kauk\u2019s fry sausage. That\u2019s evident in the 2,000 pounds he and his cadre of butchers make every week.\n\nTraditional German cuisine remains popular around the state. \u201cYou should have bought me some liver sausage,\u201d one relative said after he\u2019d learned I had visited Kauk\u2019s. The butchers and chefs I met are artisans, guardians of a food culture that dates back hundreds of years and across three continents. But I noticed a lack of youth in the places I visited. Perhaps they are steering clear of the heavy German food, especially when so much attention is directed toward obesity. Foods cooked in lard don\u2019t necessarily subscribe to any nutritionist\u2019s plan for healthy eating. Many German recipes have stood the test of time, but some small town chefs worry that eventually no one will remember how to prepare them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really sad,\u201d Lapka says. \u201cThey\u2019ll come in and ask for a pan full of strudels. Well they could cook them, but they don\u2019t know how. It\u2019s so easy to just come buy the strudels, go home and cook them, but they don\u2019t want to do that. Once I get up there to where I can\u2019t really do it anymore, my kids have never really learned it. My daughter can do knoepfle, but she hasn\u2019t mastered strudels yet. I hope to teach them. If we don\u2019t keep this going, we\u2019re going to lose it all.\u201d\n\nIf any 20- or 30-somethings want to learn to make strudels, dumplings or fleish kuechle, they will find many willing teachers. In the meantime, a hot bowl of knoepfle soup or a plate of cheese buttons is never more than a few days away.\n\nRuth Schumacher\u2019s Cheese Buttons\n\nIngredients\n\nDough:\n\n3 cups flour\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n2 eggs\n\n3/4 cup water\n\nFilling:\n\n22 ounces cottage cheese\n\n2 eggs\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nCombine ingredients and roll out dough. Cut into 4-inch squares. Put 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture onto square. Press edges to seal. Boil for 7 to 10 minutes until they float and then drain, or fry in butter at 350 degrees for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Top with fried breadcrumbs or seasoned salt.",

The weaponry madness will fill you with glee from the outset, as will the smart graphics and obvious game engine power that allows so many zombies to feature on screen at once.

    "text": "Kolache Making\n\nAll my life I have enjoyed kolaches. My mother, an immigrant from Moravia (then Austria-Hungary) made them every Christmas and Easter. As she grew older, she would tell me what ingredients to use and how much and I became adept at making them.\n\nAlas, when she died she took the recipe with her. So I went to my cousin, Mary Palank, who was then living in Aberdeen. Mary was famous for her kolaches. She had learned to make them from her mother, my aunt. \"Come,\" she said. \"We'll make some in the morning.\"\n\nWhen I came into the kitchen she had everything ready. \"See this little blue bowl? I fill it up to here with flour for the sponge.\"\n\nI objected. \"But Mary, when I get back home I won't have your little blue bowl.\"\n\nSo she measured out the ingredients in her time-tried way and I reduced the measurements to standard cups, teaspoons and tablespoons. In the course of the morning I covered two sheets of paper with notes and in the afternoon we visited over oven-warm kolaches and coffee.\n\nWhen I got home I reduced the notes to one succinct page, which is my standard recipe. I've shared the recipe with many friends who have followed it successfully, too.\n\nKolaches\n\nRecipe from Mary Palank and Genevieve Arntz\n\nDough\n\n2 packages active dry yeast\n\n1 cup warm water\n\n2 cups warm milk, divided\n\n7-8 cups flour, divided\n\n3/4 cup sugar\n\n3 eggs (room temperature)\n\n2 tablespoons salt\n\n1 cup vegetable oil or shortening\n\nUsing a large mixing bowl, dissolve 2 packages of yeast in 1 cup warm water. Add 1 cup warm milk, 2 cups flour, and stir until smooth. Let stand in a warm place until it triples in size.\n\nTo this mixture, add 3/4 cup sugar, 3 eggs, salt, 1 cup warm milk and vegetable oil or shortening. Mix well, then gradually add 6-7 cups of flour, until a very soft dough is formed. On a board, knead in flour until dough does not stick to hands. Grease top with vegetable oil and let rise. Punch down and let rise again.\n\nCottage Cheese Filling\n\n2 pounds low fat, small curd cottage cheese, wrapped in a cloth and squeezed to remove whey, or baker\u2019s cheese\n\n2 egg yolks\n\n1 1/2 cups sugar\n\n2 cups raisins\n\n1 tablespoon butter or margarine\n\nMix cottage cheese or baker\u2019s cheese with egg yolks, sugar, butter and raisins.\n\nNote: plum or other thick jams also make good fillings.\n\nStreusel\n\n1 cup flour\n\n1 stick margarine\n\n3/4 cup sugar\n\n2 teaspoons cinnamon\n\nMix all ingredients together.\n\nTo form kolaches: Grease hands. Spoon out about 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup of dough, or divide dough into 30-32 portions. Using your hands, roll each piece of dough into a small ball, then flatten it. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of the dough; draw the sides of the dough up over the filling, overlapping. Place on greased baking tin and pat flat. Oil top with salad oil. Place about 1 teaspoon of streusel topping on each oiled bun.\n\nLet kolaches rise until doubled in bulk. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and bake for about 20 minutes. Oil the sides of the bun and the topping with salad oil and cool. Store in cool place.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story is revised from the March/April 1993 issue of South Dakota Magazine.

    "text": "While the biggest stars may always get drawn to the best teams, this season's Premier League has seen a bigger spread of talent than perhaps ever before.\n\nLeicester proved last season that there is value to be found outside the big names, while the likes of Dimitri Payet and Joe Allen starred at Euro 2016 despite not playing for the biggest teams.\n\nWith that in mind, our reporters were tasked with putting together the best Premier League team they could, without using a single player from the current top six in the table.\n\nThere are a few surprises, but do you agree with our experts?\n\nVirgil van Dijk is our most-picked player in a team of players from outside the top six\n\nRob Draper\n\n(4-2-3-1): Jordan Pickford (Sunderland); Adam Smith (Bournemouth), Michael Keane (Burnley), Virgil van Dijk, (Southampton), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton); Harry Arter (Bournemouth) Idrissa Gueye (Everton); Matt Phillips (West Brom) Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea), Michail Antonio (West Ham); Salomon Rondon (West Ham)\n\nPickford has been outstanding in a difficult season; Van Dijk contributes to impress and Keane has made the step up to Premier League.\n\nAntonio has been a revelation, Phillips superbly consistent and Sigurdsson is simply a class player, who might have stayed and played at Spurs.\n\nUp front, Defoe might have scored more goals but Rondon is a more youthful and surprising package this season.\n\nSwansea may be in real trouble this season, but Gylfi Sigurdsson remains a top-class player\n\nMike Keegan\n\n(4-1-3-2): Tom Heaton (Burnley); Seamus Coleman (Everton), Jose Fonte (Southampton), Michael Keane (Burnley), Patrick van Aanholt (Sunderland); Danny Drinkwater (Leicester); Sofiane Boufal (Southampton), Riyad Mahrez (Leicester), Dimitri Payet (West Ham); Romelu Lukaku (Everton), Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\n\nI\u2019ve gone for my best XI and crowbarred them into a 4-1-3-2. It\u2019s hard to ignore Leicester\u2019s contingent, who I think will finish the season strongly.\n\nSofiane Boufal gets better every week while Patrick van Aanholt shines in struggle on a regular basis.\n\nSofiane Boufal (left) had a slow start to life at Southampton, but is getting better every week\n\nLaurie Whitwell\n\n(4-1-3-2) Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester); Seamus Coleman (Everton), Jonny Evans (West Brom), Virgil van Dijk (Southampton), Christian Fuchs (Leicester); Darren Fletcher (West Brom); Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea), Joe Allen (Stoke), Dimitri Payet (West Ham); Salomon Rondon (West Brom), Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\n\nThis team contains strength, pace, and technical skill with a balance throughout.\n\nDarren Fetcher provides the bite in midfield, just edging Idrissa Gueye for his experience, while Joe Allen and Gylfi Sigurdsson are shoe-ins for their quality.\n\nJamie Vardy would feed well off Salomon Rondon, a bull of a striker, and Dimitri Payet\u2019s game still edges substance over style.\n\nThe defensive unit is a blend of resolve and attacking potential, while Kasper Schmeichel proves his class consistently.\n\nWest Ham star Dimitri Payet was superb last season and his game still has substance and style\n\nSam Cunningham\n\n(4-2-3-1): Fraser Forster (Southampton); Seamus Coleman (Everton), Virgil van Dijk (Southampton), Jose Fonte (Southampton), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton); Jack Wilshere (Bournemouth), Oriol Romeu (Southampton); Michail Antonio (West Ham), Riyad Mahrez (Leicester), Dimitri Payet (West Ham); Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\n\nThe majority of the defence and goalkeeper are taken from the best defensive side in the league outside the top six, Southampton. Behind Chelsea they have the second best defensive record this season.\n\nThe shielding midfielders combine strength and creativity. In attacking midfield and up top is pace and power and it is a team full of goals.\n\nSince joining Bournemouth on loan from Arsenal Jack Wilshere has begun to impress again\n\nDominic King\n\n(4-2-3-1) Jordan Pickford (Sunderland); Adam Smith (Bournemouth), Michael Keane (Burnley), Virgil van Dijk (Southampton), Aaron Cresswell (West Ham); Idrissa Gueye (Everton), Danny Drinkwater (Leicester); Riyad Mahrez (Leicester), Joe Allen (Stoke), Dimitri Payet (West Ham); Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\n\nThis might give you an idea of strength of the Premier League: how much would it cost to assemble on the open market? You would probably wouldn\u2019t get much change out of \u00a3200million.\n\nStarting off with the best young goalkeeper in England, this team has a colossal central defender, strength in midfielder and excitement \u2013 not to mention goals \u2013 going forward.\n\nA forward line with Mahrez, Payet and Lukaku? Yes please.\n\nRomelu Lukaku leads the way up front, the Everton striker picked in five of our reporters' sides\n\nCraig Hope\n\n(4-4-2): Jordan Pickford (Sunderland); Seamus Coleman (Everton), Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough), Virgil van Dijk (Southampton), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton); Dimitri Payet (West Ham), Danny Drinkwater (Leicester), Adam Forshaw (Middlesbrough), Riyad Mahrez (Leicester); Jermain Defoe (Sunderland), Jamie Vardy (Leicester)\n\nThere are four North-East players in there, and that may surprise some. But I watch this quartet every week and, in the case of Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe, Sunderland would perhaps already been as good as down without them.\n\nPickford is a future England international but so, too, are Boro's Ben Gibson and Adam Forshaw, who have been excellent this season.\n\nThis team, I believe, would threaten the top six and perhaps even higher.\n\nJermain Defoe's goals have been one of the few positives in Sunderland's season so far\n\nSami Mokbel\n\n(4-2-3-1): Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester); Adam Smith (Bournemouth), Virgil van Dijk (Southampton), Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough), Leighton Baines (Everton); Jack Wilshere (Bournemouth), Danny Drinkwater (Leicester); Jamie Vardy (Leicester), Ross Barkley (Everton), Dimitri Payet (West Ham); Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\n\nAside from Ben Gibson and Adam Smith, this team is full of top international experience.\n\nThe front four of Lukaku, Payet, Barkley and Vardy would cause any team in the Premier League problems.\n\nAnd with three Leicester players involved they\u2019ll know all about upsetting the odds.\n\nMiddelsbrough's Ben Gibson may not been the most experienced, but he has been quality\n\nAdam Shergold\n\n(4-2-3-1) Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester); Seamus Coleman (Everton), Virgil van Dijk (Southampton), Michael Keane (Burnley), Leighton Baines (Everton); Idrissa Gueye (Everton), Danny Drinkwater (Leicester); Riyad Mahrez (Leicester), Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea), Dimitri Payet (West Ham); Romelu Lukaku (Everton)\n\nDespite Leicester's struggles this season, three of their players make my team - Kasper Schmeichel, Danny Drinkwater and Riyad Mahrez.\n\nFour from Everton, too, including their wing-backs, the increasingly influential Idrissa Gueye and leading scorer Romelu Lukaku.\n\nWest Ham's Dimitri Payet is an obvious pick, as is in-demand Southampton centre-back Virgil van Dijk and Swansea talisman Gylfi Sigurdsson.",

    "title": "How to fix 'camera failed' on Samsung Galaxy devices",
    "text": "We\u2019ve heard many reports of the error message 'Warning: Camera Failed' occurring on Android devices, and it seems to happen most often to Samsung owners. The good news is that while it\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s likely a software problem rather than fault with your camera. Here\u2019s how to fix 'camera failed' on Samsung Galaxy devices.\n\nJump directly to:\n\nThe steps detailed below aren\u2019t difficult or time-consuming, but you should make sure your device has a decent charge in its battery before you attempt them. If the battery level is too low, the camera often won't work, so it's worth ruling that out before you start trying anything else. In most cases, these solutions won't involve losing any photos or data from your device, but we recommend backing up anything you don't want to lose, especially if it gets to the point where you need to perform a factory reset.\n\nTry all of these steps in order, until one of them fixes your phone's camera issue:\n\nRestart the phone.\n\nIf restarting doesn't work, clear the cache and data of the camera app by Settings > Applications > Application manager > Camera app. Then tap Force Stop, and go to the Storage menu, where you select Clear Data and Clear Cache.\n\nIf clearing your camera app data and cache didn't work, the wipe your cache partition. Turn the phone off, press the Power, Home, and Volume Up buttons together and hold until you see the Samsung logo pop up on the screen and the phone goes to its recovery mode. Use the Volume down button to scroll to Wipe Cache Partition and then press the Power button to begin. Once you're done, restart your phone.\n\nIf all of that doesn't work, the problem likely has to do with Smart Stay. Some users have reported that there seems to be a software error when the rear camera starts up, but only when this function is on, likely because Smart Stay is already using the front camera to detect when you're looking at the screen so it stays on. Go to your phone's display settings menu and turn off Smart Stay to fix the issue temporarily. The long term fix for this, according to Samsung, is to make sure your phone's software is up to date, since the software issue has already been fixed in one of the updates.\n\nHow to fix 'Camera Failed' on Android: Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge\n\nReports of 'camera failed' errors on the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are rare, but some users do experience them. In most cases, the problem appears to be a third-party app that\u2019s messed things up, so booting into safe mode is the way to test that: turn off your phone, press and hold the Power key and, when the Samsung logo appears, release it and hold the Volume Down button instead. Your phone should now restart in safe mode.\n\nIf the camera works in this mode, you don\u2019t have a hardware or firmware problem. Unfortunately if it doesn\u2019t work in safe mode, then you might. Don\u2019t go rushing to your retailer just yet, though: try the steps detailed above first. In many cases a factory reset can give your device the kick it needs to sort out the camera problem.\n\nCamera issues on the S6 Edge are usually due to third party apps misbehaving. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nHow to fix 'Camera Failed' on Android: Samsung Galaxy S5\n\nIf you have a Samsung Galaxy S5, we have good news and bad news about this one. The good news is that there\u2019s a very high chance the camera failed error has the same cause and solution(s) as it does for the S3 and S4. The bad news is that there\u2019s a small chance that your device may actually have a hardware fault; a limited number of S5 devices did suffer from faulty cameras.\n\nThe first thing to do is to follow the steps detailed above, but if none of them work, then you may need to talk to your retailer, carrier or Samsung itself, depending on who you bought the S5 from.\n\nIn some rare cases, the Galaxy S5 cameras were actually faulty. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nHow to fix 'Camera Failed' on Android: Samsung Galaxy S3 or Samsung Galaxy S4\n\nIn many cases, the 'camera failed' error occurs because the Camera app has got itself into a bit of a mess. You can often solve that with a fairly simple bit of housekeeping. Go into Settings > Applications Manager and then swipe left for All Apps. Scroll down to the Camera app and tap on it. Now tap on Force Stop, then Clear Cache, then Clear Data. Don\u2019t worry: this won\u2019t delete any of your photographs, but it will delete your camera\u2019s settings so you\u2019ll need to set those again. Reboot your phone and see if that worked.\n\nIf it didn\u2019t, step two is to clear the cache partition. To do that, turn off your phone and then press and hold Volume Up, Power and Home. Once the phone vibrates, let go of Power but keep the other two buttons pressed. Once you see the Android Recovery screen, navigate to Wipe Cache Partition using the volume down key and use Power to select it. This won\u2019t delete your data but it should reset the app\u2019s cache, which should solve the problem.\n\nNothing? Time for the nuclear option: a factory reset. Make sure you take backups of anything you need first, as this will return your phone to factory-fresh condition without any of your stuff on it.\n\nStill no joy? Dump the app altogether and try the excellent Google Camera (KitKat or later required) or one of the many wonderful third-party camera apps out there. Read the reviews carefully though: some camera apps are better than others. There's no point in installing a lame one.\n\nIf all else fails, clearing the system cache on any Android device can help fix little annoying errors. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nHave you encountered the infamous 'camera fail' error on your Android device? Was it on a Samsung or on something else entirely? Was an app the culprit, or did you have to take the device back to the shop? Let us know in the comments.",

    "title": "The Best of Both Worlds",
    "text": "In the third of a four-part series on cross-training in the May 2013 issue of Barrel Horse News, we learned how cutting has influenced some of today\u2019s best barrel racers and how to apply some concepts from cow work to make the most of the cloverleaf calling. Here, we share a statistical sample of our findings in researching the top horses with earnings in both events.\n\nMarilyn Camarillo of Lamar, Colorado, has a decided preference for cutting blood and a knack for bringing barrel racing potential out of a horse that got its start in the cutting pen, as evidenced by Lanes Dry, No. 16 on the following Equi-Stat chart, and Marilyn Camarillo instructs a young rider.Michael J, another notable multi-disciplined mount not listed here.\n\n\u201cI can get one going much faster if he comes from the cutting pen because he\u2019s more broke,\u201d Camarillo said. \u201cA cow horse has got to stop, turn, and be gone quick. Likewise, a barrel horse has to gather his feet to turn. Cutters mature earlier; they have a good brain and can take the pressure. They don\u2019t have the temper a racehorse has, either. All a racehorse has been taught is to go fast forward. Stop is not in their vocabulary, and I understand that. The easiest thing to do is teach a horse to run, but it\u2019s hard to teach one to gather and turn around.\u201d\n\nCamarillo emphasizes that while barrel horses need some degree of speed and athleticism, they don't necessarily need a 100+ speed index to win on the cloverleaf.\n\n\u201cA barrel horse doesn\u2019t have to be a AAA horse,\u201d Camarillo said. \u201cConnie Combs' bay stud, Maude\u2019s Joak, had a 69 speed index. I didn\u2019t know you could go that slow, but he won the [WPRA World Champion Barrel Racer].\u201d\n\nNaturally, one stipulation in making a cutting horse a winner in a timed event is that he must have the speed to stop the clock. In any case, Camarillo insists that cutting blood needs to be pretty close, while running blood can be further back on the pedigree. She prefers a good dose of cow horse lineage and is fond of Miss N Cash breeding in particular.\n\nBarrel racing horses and cutting horses share many of the same skill sets necessary for success\u2014athleticism, quickness, collection and agility along with a good mind and a solid training foundation.\u201cHe was by Dash For Cash and out of Doc N Missy, who sold at the Snaffle Bit sale for $40,000. That was a lot of money back then,\" Camarillo said. \"They bred her to Dash For Cash, which I thought was a strange cross. Why would you breed this really good cow horse mare to a racehorse? But it worked. Go back to Easy Jet and Smooth Herman. They were full brothers\u2014one went to the cutting world and one went to the racehorse world.\u201d\n\nThe unique EquiStat chart below reveals the top 25 horses that managed to gain earnings in both the cutting and the barrel racing arenas.\n\n(All data copyrighted 2013 by Cowboy Publishing Group and cannot be reproduced in any form without permission.)\n\nCUTTING AND BARRELS\n\n1.

    "title": "Amaranth: The Once and Future Crop?",
    "text": "Amaranth: The Once and Future Crop?\n\nCould a plant grown as a food crop 1,000 years ago in what is now South Dakota be one of the state\u2019s answers to coming dry seasons? That is the question I arrived at after a yearlong probe into the peculiar properties, mysterious origins and current development of the plant called amaranth.\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard the word before but have only a sketchy idea of what it is, you may be surprised to know that it is a product on the market right now, appearing on health food shelves and in mainstream items like bread and cereal. And, it is increasingly popular with gardeners who find it fascinating for its ease of cultivation, colorful appearance and diverse uses in the kitchen.\n\nI embarked on my personal voyage of discovery while writing a book about the Prehistoric Indian Village on the shore of Lake Mitchell, which was inhabited before there was a lake. The book, Village on the Bluff: Prehistoric Farmers/Hunters of the James River Valley, was commissioned by Dr. L. Adrien Hannus, director of the Archeology Laboratory at Augustana College in Sioux Falls. Dr. Hannus told me he wanted an informative layman\u2019s view of the site. Since I was highly qualified as a layman, and not lacking in curiosity or guts, I gladly took the job. Who knew where it would lead?\n\nThe people who inhabited the Mitchell site 1,000 years ago were influenced by the Mississippian culture, which had its center at Cahokia, near what is now St. Louis. The culture included elements carried from further south in the Valley of Mexico. The villagers relied heavily on hunting bison and their vegetable diet, which consisted mostly of crops grown in the valley near the creek, wild berries, roots and other native foodstuffs. Microscopic examination of pollen discovered at the site showed that principal crops were the famous \u201cThree Sisters\u201d originating in Mexico and Central America \u2014 maize, beans and squash. But also present were pollen from sunflowers and amaranth.\n\nI was so intrigued by the knowledge that amaranth was cultivated by these ancient peoples that I endeavored to learn more about it. I found enough to write on the subject, but then I decided to grow some. I can report that growing amaranth is not daunting. I was easily able to obtain appropriate seed varieties, two reds and one golden, and in early spring of 2012 I started the plants in peat pots indoors by a sunny window. The plants tend to be frail in the early stages, and I wanted to take no chances with the seeds not reaching maturity. By the time the weather grew warmer, I had enough sturdy plants to make three rows in a 4-foot by 8-foot bed and another row of about 10 feet, with plants left over to stick in odd spots in the garden.\n\nThe plants grew vigorously, despite the low-moisture spring and summer. The hot, dry weather was disastrous for my beans, cucumbers and most other vegetables, but the amaranth flourished. By fall, the plants stood 2 to 5 feet tall and the colorful, plume-like heads were heavy with seeds. Harvesting and threshing are often accomplished in one step, usually just after the first frost, by bending the heads into a pail and shaking or beating the plant so that the seeds fall. I wanted to conserve as many seeds as possible, so I snapped off the heads and put them in a plastic bag.\n\nThreshing was a bit trickier. The seeds are so light that winnowing in the wind, as I have done successfully with wheat, was out of the question; too many seeds would be lost. Various methods have been suggested, but none seem foolproof. I chose to use gloves to rub off the seeds (since the stems and chaff can be prickly and rough on bare fingers) and then collect the seeds and chaff in a bowl. A screen of the proper size can be used to sift out stems and much of the chaff, or by carefully shaking the bowl one can separate the seeds and chaff by weight and gently blow to skim off the chaff. Remaining chaff and stem parts can be removed by hand. If some chaff is left it is not a disaster \u2014 while annoying, it is edible.\n\nOf the five plant species discovered at the Mitchell site, amaranth is unique in two respects. First, it is the only one of the group not thought to be exclusively native to the Americas. Second, it is the only one that failed to establish itself as a basic modern-day foodstuff until recently.\n\nThe fact that the name amaranthus (meaning \u201cunfading flower\u201d) has Greek roots speaks to the wide distribution of the genus around the world. Some 70 species exist in countries as far away as Australia, but few have been successfully cultivated. Nevertheless, grain amaranth was cultivated in Europe and Asia as well as the Americas in early times and was often associated with religious ceremonies, suggesting that it had a central place as a foodstuff among ancients. Some scholars suggest it may have been the very first grain, supplanted by other grains only as the latecomers attained greater size and volume.\n\nAmaranth was highly prized in Peru and Mexico. It figured among the tribute crops demanded by Aztec ruler Montezuma. With the coming of European conquistadores, however, the growing and consumption of amaranth was nearly terminated. A ban on the plant was made on religious grounds. The Catholic Church found the use of small cakes made of amaranth seed and honey (sometimes allegedly mixed with human blood) in pagan rituals, to be eerily similar to using the host during Mass, and declared it blasphemy. Today, the use of the cakes, often in the shape of skulls but without blood, survives in Mexico, particularly during the weeks leading up to the Day of the Dead. Similar cakes of popped amaranth bound with honey or syrup were eaten in China, Nepal and Argentina.\n\nAmong tribes north of the border, amaranth was assigned other uses, as well. In the Southwest, Hopis used a red dye from one species as food coloring and for other coloring purposes.\n\nGiven the widespread use of the plant in ancient times, it is curious that amaranth holds such a small niche in today\u2019s market. Other foods from Central and South America have had amazing success. Corn products are virtually ubiquitous, with such ingredients as corn syrup found in a wide selection of products. Beans and squash are also widely consumed. Even the sunflower seed has risen to widespread popularity as a snack. Mention the word amaranth to most people, however, and you will be repaid with blank stares.\n\nHow exactly amaranth was used by prehistoric people who populated land along the waterways of the Mississippi drainage is a matter of conjecture. The fact that the seed of the plant is rich in gluten-free protein (better than any other common cereal, and a particularly good source of the amino acid lysine), along with calcium, vitamins and other essential building blocks, may be a clue to its use 1,000 years ago.\n\nContrary to expectations, according to Dr. Hannus, the people of the Village on the Bluff may not have had a regular supply of fresh meat. The protein in amaranth may have helped fill dietary gaps.\n\nToday amaranth is easily available in supermarket health food sections, in stores devoted to health foods or from web sites. I was fascinated to discover that the seeds could be popped like popcorn, boiled whole for gruel or for soups, ground for inclusion in hot cereals, pancakes, muffins, or other baked goods, sprouted for salads, or made into breakfast flakes. I started including amaranth in my diet. I was particularly proud of my Sunday pancakes, with amaranth, flax, and oat bran added to ease the guilt of a tasty weekly treat.\n\nThe young and tender leaves of amaranth plants are edible and are often harvested early in the season and used in salads or cooked as greens. The greens are many times richer in antioxidants than most other salad greens.\n\nWhat does amaranth taste like? The adjective \u201cnutty\u201d leaps to mind, but I\u2019ve also seen it described as \u201cpeppery.\u201d Popped, with a little salt and butter added, it tastes very much like miniature popcorn. Puffed, mixed with heated honey, it will remind you of Rice Krispy bars. In mixtures with other grains and baked or used as a thickener in soups, it imparts a delicate flavor all its own.\n\nIf there are commercial growers of amaranth in South Dakota, they are doing a good job of keeping it a secret. Organic farmers, plant specialists and packagers I contacted could not recall anyone in the state raising the crop. When asked why, they came up with reasons ranging from \u201conce bit, twice shy,\u201d through \u201calcohol addiction,\u201d to \u201ca black sheep in the family.\u201d\n\nPaul O. Johnson, South Dakota State University extension agronomy field specialist based in Watertown, cites the Jerusalem artichoke fiasco as a possible reason that growers in this state are wary of \u201cnovelty crops\u201d like amaranth. Many farmers were stung in the early 1980s when a firm called American Energy Farming Systems (AEFS) touted Jerusalem artichokes as a drought-resistant, high-return crop with unbelievable potential for development. Of course, what seems unbelievable often should not be believed. Some growers paid exorbitant prices for seed plants (often over $1,000 per acre sown), and found themselves at harvest time with little or no market for their crop. AEFS soon went bankrupt. Farmers with a long memory can hardly be blamed for being suspicious of get-rich talk about a crop with a funny name.\n\nLike other plants grown in the Prehistoric Village, amaranth now seems to be here to stay, and it offers opportunities for enterprising growers. Its novelty, the combination of its value as an ornamental and as a fun and nutritious food, and the ease of its cultivation and harvesting, make it a welcome addition to the growing beds of those who love gardening.\n\nFive Sisters Stew\n\nFor the fun of it, I created this stew mostly using ingredients that might have been found at the Prehistoric Village, particularly those foodstuffs common to the Mississippian culture. You could add a cup of whole corn if you wanted to make that ingredient seem less of an afterthought. By the way, say what you will, both amaranth and refried beans make excellent thickeners. I think you will find this dish to be rich, creamy and satisfying.\n\n1/4 cup chopped sweet onion\n\n1/2 cup chopped celery\n\n2 tablespoons butter or vegetable oil\n\n1/2 cup cooked amaranth\n\n1 1/2 cups cooked butternut squash\n\n1 cup refried beans (about 7 ounces or half a can)\n\n1 can diced tomatoes\n\n1/2 cup vegetable broth\n\n1/2 tsp. cumin\n\n1/2 tsp. salt (or to taste)\n\n1 tbsp. Cholula hot sauce\n\nA sprig of cilantro, tortilla chips, and sunflower seeds to garnish.\n\nHeat butter or oil in a two-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and celery and saut\u00e9 until onion is clear and soft. Add amaranth, squash, and refried beans and stir thoroughly. Add tomatoes and cook. Flavor with cumin, salt, and hot sauce. Add broth to bring to desired consistency. Garnish with cilantro, chips, and sunflower seeds.\n\nMakes about four servings.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story is revised from the March/April 2013 issue of South Dakota Magazine.

    "title": "Xiaomi Mi MIX review: who needs a bezel anyway?",
    "text": "Through the Xiaomi Mi MIX, we come to the end of 2016 with one of the most interesting smartphones of the year. The Mi MIX gives us a hint of how smartphones could look in 2017. Xiaomi combines an almost borderless display in the Mi MIX with new and high quality materials. This Chinese company has shown the smartphone establishment how to put a concept smartphone into actual production. The best Chinese smartphones\n\nXiaomi Mi 5s Plus review\n\nRating\n\nGood \u2713 Excellent workmanship\n\n\u2713 Exciting (almost) borderless display\n\n\u2713 Good performance\n\n\u2713 Decent battery life Bad \u2715 Both cameras are only satisfactory\n\n\u2715 Slippery surfaces\n\n\u2715 Fingerprint magnet\n\n\u2715 Piezoelectric acoustic element projects sound widely\n\nXiaomi Mi MIX design and build quality The Xiaomi Mi MIX will definitely enchant you when it comes to design and workmanship. When switched off, the Mi MIX looks like a black monolith. There is nothing on the front that suggests that this rectangular object is in fact a smartphone. Only at second glance do you notice the front camera in the lower right corner. Xiaomi Mi MIX: somewhat of a monolith. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT For the first time ever, Xiaomi has opted to use ceramic as a material in one of its smartphones. OnePlus used ceramic in a limited version of the OnePlus X. The material is heat-resistant, extremely hard, but unfortunately quite fragile at the same time. So if you get a Xiaomi Mi MIX, you won\u2019t have to worry about scratches on the barely polished case, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t drop it. The workmanship is excellent... / \u00a9 AndroidPIT The high-gloss material has two other disadvantages: it is absolutely not fingerprint-repellent. Even the smallest touch leaves unsightly greasy prints. In addition, the material is slippery. When you hold the Mi MIX, you constantly feel like it\u2019s about to slip out of your hand and fall to the floor. To mask these two disadvantages, the Mi MIX has a leather cover. This makes it more grippy and obviously you won\u2019t be able to leave fingerprints on the back anymore. All the buttons sit flush within the ceramic frame of the Mi MIX. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT It is with impressive accuracy that Xiaomi managed to drill very small holes for the loudspeaker, headphone jack, microphone and SIM card holder in the brittle material. The buttons, the SIM card slot and the main camera and the fingerprint sensor on the back are very precisely fitted. The workmanship is excellent across the whole smartphone. While in theory it is a great idea, the leather-like protective cover of Xiaomi is really badly implemented. If you use this cover on a daily basis, the rear fingerprint sensor becomes unusable. The protective cover is too thick, so the fingerprint sensor can\u2019t work properly and you end up having to enter your PIN code or security pattern to unlock the Mi MIX. Fortunately, Xiaomi has included the protective cover with the Mi MIX so you don\u2019t have to pay for the cover separately. The leather protective cover is too thick, so the fingerprint sensor is barely usable in everyday life. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nXiaomi Mi MIX display The main highlight of the Xiaomi Mi MIX is obvious: its display. Its aim isn\u2019t to impress through high resolutions, high pixel densities or OLED technology, but rather through its almost edgeless integration into the smartphone housing. The 6.4-inch display takes up almost the entire front of the phone. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT The IPS LCD screen on our review device comes with AIDA64 from Sharp and, according to the technical specifications provided by Xiaomi, it should be 2,040 x 1,080 pixels. The pixel density is 362 ppi. Purely from these data, it does not appear to be a top-level smartphone, but the integration of the 6.4-inch display within a housing that is barely bigger than the Huawei Mate 9 is impressive. You may think you\u2019re subtly holding a smartphone with a borderless display until you suddenly realize that there is a small crowd surrounding you, all trying to get a look. Unique technological gadgets like this catch everyone\u2019s attention. The nearly borderless construction of the display on three sides has forced Xiaomi to break with old smartphone or even cell phone tradition. Even at first glance (even a non-techie would notice), it would appear that there is no space for the usual speaker. Instead, Xiaomi uses a piezoelectric acoustic system. In simple terms, the DAC (digital-to-analog converter) oscillates a piezoeletic ceramic component installed inside the Mi MIX against the metal frame. Our ears then perceive these vibrations as sound. The classic phone speaker had to give way at some point. / \u00a9 Xiaomi Although conventional speakers have been removed from this smartphone through this technology, a disadvantage is that the conversation also gets dispersed into the surrounding environment and may even breach on being annoying for those around you. For a more confidential conversation, the Mi MIX user should use some good headphones. However, you would have to invest in these yourself, because Xiaomi does not include a set of headphones with the Mi MIX. Xiaomi even had to rethink the proximity sensor on the Mi MIX. Conventional smartphones have an infrared sensor that turns the display off when you hold the smartphone to your head. Since such a sensor requires direct unblocked access to the external environment of the phone, this option was not feasible on the Mi MIX. So Xiaomi used a new sensor that is based on a different technique. Ultrasound does not require direct contact to the outside world. Behind the upper part of the display on the Mi MIX, an ultrasonic sensor is hidden, which reliably detects when objects are close to the display and deactivates the screen. The Mi MIX has an ultrasonic proximity sensor to detect if an object is near or far. / \u00a9 Xiaomi Xiaomi has been able to adequately replace conventional elements through the use of state-of-the-art technology. But one component that is not so easy to replace is the front camera. Xiaomi had to compromise and put the camera in the bottom right corner of the front of the phone, outside of the display. A disadvantage of placing the camera here is the unusual perspective. Fortunately, Xiaomi has found a little workaround to this, which I will delve into deeper in the camera section of this review. The nearly edgeless display has never been seen before on a smartphone. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the Mi MIX has an unusual resolution of 2,040 x 1,080. Under normal use, the navigation buttons are displayed in the lower edge of the display, such that the classic Full HD resolution (1,920 x 1,080) is visible. In the MIUI settings of the Mi MIX, these buttons can be hidden when not in use. If you do this, the full 2,040 x 1,080 pixels then become available for other content. Unfortunately, games or videos do not support this resolution; only MIUI and the preinstalled apps work with it. Ugly black bars will appear around the app display.\n\nXiaomi Mi MIX software Xiaomi installed the Android 6.0.1-based MIUI 8 on the Mi MIX. Since the Mi MIX is actually only sold in China, Google Apps do not come preinstalled. Some importers like Trading Shenzhen will install these onto the device beforehand, therefore the use of Google Apps and services should not hinder your decision to purchase a Xiaomi Mi MIX. MIUI 8, which is based on Android 6.0.1, comes preinstalled on the Xiaomi Mi MIX. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT Compared with MIUI on a Xiaomi Mi 5s, not much has changed. The only thing worth mentioning is Quickball, which makes it easier to handle and use large phablets with one hand. Quickball is dragged out of the navigation bar into the visible area of \u200b\u200bthe display and offers you numerous quick start functions, but it does take a while to get used to Quickball. Xiaomi is perpetually lagging far behind other manufacturers in terms of Android updates. A software update is offered at least once a month, but MIUI 8 is still based on Android 6.0.1. A MIUI version based on Android Nougat will surely come into existence, but it\u2019s not very likely that it will be delivered in the first half of 2017. Once we know more about Xiaomi's Android update schedule, we\u2019ll let you know about it in our Android Nougat update article, which we update regularly.\n\nXiaomi Mi MIX performance Xiaomi has not compromised on any equipment in the Mi MIX. Under the hood, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor with Adreno 530 GPU is used. Our review device is equipped with 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage. Because Xiaomi's internal memory is based on fast UFS 2.0, the performance should be on par with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Huawei Mate 9. However, after we measured the performance of the device with our selected benchmark apps, we were slightly disappointed. The fastest smartphone processor The Xiaomi Mi MIX was inferior in every aspect to the Huawei Mate 9 and in some cases, also to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. However, in daily life, the Mi MIX proves to be a fast everyday companion. There were no apps that forced the smartphone to the buckle at the knees, so to speak, and the phone didn\u2019t heat up very much. In short, the performance of the Mi MIX hardware is more than enough to provide the user with a fluid experience of MIUI 8. The main feature of the Xiaomi Mi MIX lies not with its inner beauty in the form of an unprecedented processor, graphics or memory performance. The highlight remains the external appearance of the phone.\n\nXiaomi Mi MIX audio The Xiaomi Mi MIX has a mono speaker that radiates outwards. The Mi MIX does not have stereo sound, which works best when outputted from the front. But despite this, there is space for a 3.5 mm jack for wired headphones and headsets. These are also definitely needed because, as already mentioned in the display section, a call containing any sensitive or confidential conversation certainly cannot be done owing to the piezoelectric audio technology embedded in the phone.\n\nXiaomi Mi MIX camera In the Mi Mix, Xiaomi installed a camera module with 16 MP of maximum resolution with electronic image stabilizer and aperture f/2.0. It was probably not possible to integrate an optical image stabilizer due to the flatness of the main camera. For design reasons, the front camera had to be moved to the lower right corner of the phone. Those of you who are more familiar with the Android world will know that the same layout already exists on the Dell Venue 8 7840 tablet. There too the front camera had to be moved to this unusual location because the display was almost borderless. Fortunately, the Mi MIX really hold its own through the camera app. If you rotate the phone 180 degrees, the app will adjust. With this feature, you can avoid those \u201cfrog view\u201d selfies. The camera is flush with the back of the phone so unfortunately, the optical image stabilizer is no longer necessary. / \u00a9 ANDROIDPIT I\u2019m sure Xiaomi have their own reasons for putting an 18-carat gold frame on the camera but sadly, the camera doesn\u2019t fit the otherwise high-quality elements of this device. The autofocus is slow, the shutter speed and also light sensitivity do not correspond to a smartphone of this price class. There isn\u2019t much more to be said about the camera on the Xiaomi Mi MIX, there are simply no highlights that can win my favor. Too bad. All the pictures taken for our review can be found here in full resolution Thanks to the edgeless display, you can play about quite a bit on the Mi MIX. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nXiaomi Mi MIX battery You can guess from the size of the Xiaomi Mi MIX that it hosts a large battery inside. The battery has a capacity of 4,400 mAh. At almost the same dimensions as the Huawei Mate 9 (4,000 mAh), it gives an extra 10 percent of juice. Since the display resolution is a little more than Full HD, the Mi MIX should have quite similar run times as the Huawei Mate 9, if it doesn\u2019t exceed these. The Xiaomi Mi MIX is charged with USB Type-C. / \u00a9 AndroidPIT Normally in our reviews, we leave the battery continuously running and test it with PCMark. This allows us to test the smartphone battery extensively. Unfortunately though, this time we encountered some issues, as the PCMark database simply did not recognize the Xiaomi Mi MIX and thus it couldn\u2019t divulge a value. Luckily, you can still look at the battery history in the settings. This showed us a running time of 9 hours and 35 minutes from 100 percent charge to just under 20 percent. The Huawei Mate 9 came underwent the same test in just under 13 hours. You have to remember though that the Huawei phone has a smaller display and through Android 7.0 Nougat and Doze, it has a better battery than the Xiaomi Mi MIX.\n\nFinal verdict The Xiaomi Mi MIX leaves you with a general impression of high-quality. Unfortunately though, the ceramic case is prone to fingerprint marks and the smooth surface coupled with the relatively heavy weight of 209 grams doesn\u2019t assure a secure grip and you often feel like the phone is about to slip out of your hand - inevitably falling to it\u2019s irreparably damaged doom. But as soon as the (almost) borderless display shines, these niggling worries are washed away and it\u2019s all you can do but stare at the display with pure amazement. One can forgive the low resolution display. As well as the almost embarrassing camera on the Xiaomi Mi MIX, the performance lags far behind its competition or even the huge battery with a sub-par running time. Just why? It\u2019s probably for the same reason that you forgive the faults of a sports car or a convertible: it\u2019s about what it looks like and the emotions it evokes. For the Mi MIX, it\u2019s all about the exterior. Excellent workmanship, a borderless display and almost certainly the exclusivity of a hard-to-find smartphone has convinced me. As is the case with a rare car, you look beyond the tiny trunk, the horrendously bumpy suspension and other impractical features. The only question that remains is how long can one forego these features in everyday life, particularly the camera. At some point, the design and the display will fulfil their worth and then you'll probably wish you\u2019d bought a more balanced smartphone that is mainly just a status symbol.",

But sometimes during practice, I think two or three times, I\u2019ve broken down during practice and I started bawling because it was at one point overwhelming because we were staying in hotels for a while.\n\n\u201cI had lost my grandfather and I kind of blamed myself for that due to reasons. And then my family, everybody separated from each other. So everything was swept off from under me just really hard.\u201d\n\nM-A wrestling coach Phil Hoang wasn\u2019t aware of any of this until last December, when he inquired as to why Akinola stayed at practice until 7:30 or 8 p.m. That\u2019s when he found out that Akinola and her family were staying in a shelter.\n\n\u201cHalfway through the season last year, I did not even know that there was anything other than what you and I would see \u2014 just a happy, positive, caring and hard-working kid,\u201d Hoang said.\n\n\u201cNot everybody knows my complete story, yet,\u201d Akinola said. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t know that I was homeless or struggling for a while. Some of my closer teammates, they know about that. If I\u2019m feeling down, they\u2019ll come and talk to me. And some of my (sparring) partners, if they see I\u2019m off in a day, they\u2019ll talk to me, like, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s up? Are you OK?\u2019 They\u2019re on me and they\u2019re there for me.\u201d\n\nBond with Bears\n\nAkinola feels close to her wrestling teammates at M-A. That includes fellow sophomore Abby Ericson.\n\n\u201cI knew Abby from around campus, but because of wrestling we\u2019re with each other 24/7,\u201d Akinola said. \u201cWe were at this tournament and we just decided to go over to each other\u2019s house and have a sleepover. We\u2019ve gotten to know each other so much, and that\u2019s because of wrestling.\u201d\n\nAkinola feels like part of the Ericson family whenever she stops by for a visit, and it\u2019s a reason she has confided in Abby, who is aware of her teammate\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u201cI just told her that I\u2019d be there for her no matter what and I would support her in any way I can and I\u2019m always here for her,\u201d Ericson said.\n\nIt\u2019s a big reason why her mother didn\u2019t relocate the family to cities such as Stockton, Tracy or Manteca, where the rent is cheaper. The search for a permanent home in East Palo Alto continues.\n\n\u201cBut the rent is extremely high and that\u2019s just what it is with the Googles and the Facebooks coming through,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut we are still looking for something permanent to where we can call home. I always have to keep hope alive, I always have to believe that there are better days ahead. So I\u2019m waiting for that miracle to happen and I believe that it will. And as long as I believe, I\u2019m going to keep hope alive.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to help the family, the M-A community initiated a fundraising effort earlier this year on YouCaring.com (https://www.youcaring.com/eunice-martin-fola-martin-and-jayden-martin-536225).\n\n\u201cI could not imagine what it\u2019s like to be a kid going to Craigslist every day and try to find a home for you and your family,\u201d Hoang said. \u201cAnd then on top of that being a student.\u201d\n\nWrestling roots\n\nAkinola began to wrestle in the fifth grade at East Peninsula Wrestling Club under the tutelage of Nathan Pantoja, who still drops by to watch her compete.\n\nShe is the reigning Central Coast Section champion in the 160-pound weight class and a medalist at the CIF state championships this past February.\n\n\u201cWrestling has been always something that I love and always something that I did,\u201d said Akinola, who was a linebacker and wide receiver on the JV football team at M-A as a freshman. \u201cIn middle school with my coaches, I was really good at it and I had won at state in middle school, but then going to a higher level I knew from the first day that wrestling was going to be more of a challenge for me. And to do as well as I did, that was really amazing for me.\u201d\n\nHer r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was boosted by competing at the California USA Wrestling Folkstyle Championships in March, in which she not only won the cadet title for freshmen and sophomores, but at the last minute decided to wrestle against junior and seniors.\n\n\u201cWe kind of just went, \u2018Well, we know you\u2019re good, but let\u2019s set some expectations that you might not make it through the day,\u2019 \u201d Hoang said. \u201cAnd she did more than that, she ended up winning that tournament as well.\u201d\n\nThis caught the attention of a CA/USAW coach who invited Akinola to compete at nationals in Oklahoma, where she earned All-America status as a top-eight placer in the 172-pound cadet division.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Hoang said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest part of it. She has the spirit that she wants to do well all the time. She feels like she needs to prove something to somebody, whether it\u2019s her or the people that support her. Even if no matter how many times we told her she doesn\u2019t need to prove anything, she puts it on herself. \u2026 And something about competition just makes her so much better. When she runs into difficult things, she finds a way to overcome them.\u201d\n\nFamily\n\nThat is why Akinola still blames herself for the death of her grandfather last year. After coming home one July day in 2014, she found him unconscious on the kitchen floor and dialed 9-1-1. The stroke left him paralyzed on the right side and robbed her grandfather of his speech.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little easier to think about now, but I feel that in everything you do, with friendships and relationships, there is something that you could have done to make the situation better, I guess,\u201d Akinola said. \u201cThe doctors have told me and my mother has told me repeatedly that no time difference could have stopped the stroke that caused him to pass away.\n\n\u201cHe was my favorite person because he made me feel really special,\u201d continued Akinola, no longer able to hold back the tears. \u201cHe told me that because I was Folashade I could do and have anything I wanted. And I remember my mom used to work at the time that we would get out of school, and he would always be the one to pick us up and then take us to school. Or sometimes he would just help out my mom. He would make me my lunch and my snack, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I do it just the way that he does it whenever I make me lunch or my brother lunch.\u201d\n\nHer brother is Jayden Johnson, a rambunctious 6-year-old who is a lot like her older sister.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s energetic, he likes to have fun a lot,\u201d said Akinola, who noted Jayden likes helping with chores, which she clearly appreciates. \u201cEvery Saturday we usually do something together.\u201d\n\nFor Christmas, he\u2019s getting chalk, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coloring book and candy. In fact, Akinola was done with all of her holiday shopping almost a week in advance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m broke now,\u201d she said, with an affable smile.\n\nAkinola doesn\u2019t seem to mind being penniless if it brings joy to Jayden and her mother.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s my inspiration, actually,\u201d Akinola said. \u201cShe\u2019s a strong-minded woman and she\u2019s really one of my main support systems. She helps me do everything and she\u2019s always been there for me. I mean, when I couldn\u2019t understand why my dad wasn\u2019t here, instead of bad-mouthing him or telling me the truth, she would kind of sugarcoat it to make me feel better.\u201d\n\nThe youngest of five siblings, Martin doesn\u2019t believe that she will ever forget the time in her life where she felt most helpless, unable to get through to her daughter in a time of need.\n\nBut, in a way, Martin also feels she and Akinola are both stronger for such trials and tribulations.\n\n\u201cI had just recently lost my father, my family was falling apart over my father\u2019s death, I was going through Folashade\u2019s suicidal attempts, I have a 6-year-old, we were homeless for a while and just the hustle and bustle of everyday life,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt was hard, but I believe in God and I believe that He will not put anything on me more than I can handle. And I just had to trust that He would see me through all of that. I honestly didn\u2019t know how.\n\n\u201cI kind of thought that at some points God was testing me a little too much. I had no answers or support because it was just me. I mean, the fathers of my children are not in their life, so that was also a problem for Folashade. She felt abandoned by her father, who was maybe at one point 10 minutes away and then he moved a little bit closer to five minutes away and he still refuses to see her \u2014 no birthdays, no Christmas, no nothing.\u201d\n\nInstead, she\u2019s found a new family at M-A.\n\n\u201cFolashade found a home in Menlo-Atherton,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe found coaches and friends and wrestlers and teachers and counselors who loved her for who she was and who she is. So they really helped us and they helped her. I saw the change in her, and Folashade is the sole reason why I\u2019m still in this area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout knowing it, she has a way of getting people to gravitate toward her positivity,\u201d Hoang said. \u201cPeople tend to go way out of their way to help her, not because she needs it, but because she\u2019s one of those people that you just want to see her do well. And we don\u2019t want to see this bright light somehow extinguish because of a lack of support. Especially I think at this particular school there are a lot of caring people and caring families.\n\n\u201cAnd every family has their own set of problems, but I think in somehow helping Fola we feel that we are doing something greater than just what we\u2019re supposed to be doing. She almost gives a lot of us a sense of purpose.\u201d\n\n\u2018Wrestles with heart\u2019\n\nOn the mat, M-A also has a sense of purpose. Currently ranked No. 1 in CCS by The California Wrestler, there is no doubt that Akinola has a target on her back after a stellar freshman year.\n\nShe is undefeated and earlier this month recorded a major decision over last year\u2019s state runner-up at 150 pounds from Tokay High in Lodi.\n\n\u201cWhen you step on the mat, I\u2019m ready to go,\u201d Akinola said. \u201cI\u2019m listening to my music to get into whatever mood I need to, and when I get on the mat I have a job to do. So it\u2019s just getting in that mind-set. Being aggressive is one of the things that you need to be in this sport, and I have no problem with that.\u201d\n\nHer mother tries not to miss any of Akinola\u2019s wrestling matches and has a plethora of videos loaded on her phone as proof.\n\n\u201cI love to see her dominate the mat,\u201d Martin said. \u201cLast year she was one of the top wrestlers on her team, but she still has a lot to learn. And her coaches have all pulled together and she\u2019s more open-minded. She\u2019s learning how to do different trips and different techniques and different positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wrestles with a tremendous amount of heart and that\u2019s something you cannot teach,\u201d Hoang said. \u201cHer spirit carries her pretty far in the sport, but if she got to that level where you could focus and put in that type of effort in practice, she\u2019d be unstoppable.\u201d\n\nAkinola couldn\u2019t agree more: \u201cI\u2019m still learning how to challenge myself while in the room or in the weight room or on the mat.\u201d\n\nTeammates affectionately call her \u201cFola;\u201d it\u2019s not as fun when it\u2019s time to face off with her at practice.\n\n\u201cThey love me and everything like that, but I\u2019m really aggressive on the mat,\u201d said Akinola, who feels wrestling could open some opportunities at the college level in a few years. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m wrestling, I\u2019m going to go all out. I feel like you have to, it\u2019s what you need to do. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m also learning \u2014 control. My teammates are there for me, not so I can hurt them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it hurts,\u201d Ericson said. \u201cBut wrestling hurts and you just kind of deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe right path\n\nOne thing not allowed at practice is food, out of fear it could decompose and attract rats or other type of vermin. One day, Hoang noticed an apple and immediately notified Akinola not to leave it there because apples rot.\n\n\u201cShe looks at me and says, \u2018Rotten apples are the best, coach,\u2019 \u201d Hoang said. \u201cAnd I kind of look at her and I\u2019m like, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 And she goes, \u2018Well, because they\u2019re always the last one left.\u2019 And it just kind of took me back. I don\u2019t know if she meant that in any other way, but I sat there thinking because at that time we were the last ones at practice. And that is kind of her, she\u2019s always kind of the last one. And she\u2019s taught me a lot about perspective.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s humorous and she has this great positive energy around her despite the fact that she\u2019s gone through so much. We absolutely love having her and we want to continue to support her in every way.\u201d\n\nNo longer burdened by sharing a kitchen and bathroom with strangers in transitional housing, the hope is that those three suicide attempts within months of each other are a thing of the past. But nothing to forget.\n\n\u201cI gotta say that she\u2019s come a long way,\u201d Martin said. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t tried to hurt herself in a while. I cannot say that she doesn\u2019t have any thoughts, but the thoughts now are just frustration. It doesn\u2019t happen too often at all and she\u2019s learned to channel her frustration and her depression to where she\u2019s able to handle it a little bit better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a low self-esteem every since I was little, but I feel that I am getting better with communicating and controlling my emotions,\u201d said Akinola, who visits a counselor on a weekly basis. \u201cWhat I usually do, and I don\u2019t like to do it, but I think it\u2019s really helpful and it\u2019s really necessary, it\u2019s really important to talk to people about how you feel or when you feel like you\u2019re going down the wrong path or something.\n\n\u201cAnd then I also feel when you do get in that mood or you do feel that way about yourself, you have to realize that that\u2019s not you. The things that you\u2019re thinking, the things that you\u2019re going through, they\u2019re probably not as bad as you think it is. And so you have to step outside of yourself. I like to think, \u2018What\u2019s going good in my life? Who do I have that loves me? Who do I have that\u2019s surrounding me that I know is going to be there for me?\u2019\n\n\u201cI try to be happy every day,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing that helps me stay distracted because life is good and you have to see what\u2019s good in life, and that just really helps me, just being happy all the time. And, also, I have so much to be happy about.\u201d",

    "title": "Gloucester City 1 AFC Fylde 5: Full report and reaction",
    "text": "Fylde are top of the tree at Christmas after an emphatic victory over Gloucester City.\n\nThe Coasters warmed up for their festive double-header against local rivals Chorley with a thumping 5-1 win at Whaddon Road to remain seven points clear in the National League North.\n\nSam Avery opening the scoring for the hosts inside two minutes, but goals from Dan Bradley, Danny Rowe (2), James Hardy and Brendon Daniels made it a comfortable afternoon for Dave Challinor\u2019s side.\n\nChallinor named as strong starting line-up although it was the hosts who went close to scoring inside the first minute, when a cross field pass found Tom Webb at the back post, but Rhys Taylor acrobatically kept out the midfielder\u2019s well struck volley.\n\nHowever the deadlock was indeed broken just seconds later. Joe Hanks delivered a deep cross into the box that Rhys Taylor, under pressure from Joe Parker, dropped at the feet of Avery who had the simple task of tapping into an open net.\n\nGloucester were looking the most likely in the early stages and Zack Kotwica tested Taylor with a strike from distance.\n\nA moment of magic sparked life into the Coasters performance as Hardy skipped past four challenges after cutting in from the right before forcing Jasbir Singh into a fine save.\n\nGloucester\u2019s lead was short-lived as the Coasters drew level from the resultant corner. Brendon Daniels\u2019 inswinger wasn\u2019t dealt with and fell kindly to Bradley who poked the ball into the bottom corner from close range.\n\nTaylor had to be alert shortly before the 20-minute mark, tipping Craig Reid\u2019s left-footed effort around the post after he was given far too much time to advance towards goal. Ed Williams flicked a header wide of the far post as the hosts enjoyed a sustained spell of pressure.\n\nRowe had his first real sniff of goal when he flashed a vicious strike from 25 yards narrowly wide of the post.\n\nHowever, the frontman had his customary goal a moment later and it was one to forget for Joe Hanks. The midfielder picked up the ball on the edge of his own area but was dispossessed by Andy Bond. The loose ball fell to Rowe in acres of space and he rounded the keeper to slot the ball into the empty net.\n\nSome intricate play shortly after the restart showed Fylde\u2019s intent to go on and get the next goal.\n\nHardy broke through, backheeled to Bond who played in Bradley but his cutback was agonisingly just behind Hardy who was lurking on the six-yard line.\n\nThe youngster wasn\u2019t to be denied for long though when he picked up the ball 30 yards out, turned his man and sent the goalkeeper the wrong way with a delightful finish into the bottom left-hand corner of the goal.\n\nSingh pulled off a fine stop at his near post to deny Rowe a second but could do nothing seconds later as Fylde added a deserved fourth. Macauley Wilson delivered the ball back into the box and Singh\u2019s poor punch was straight to Daniels who headed into an open goal at the back post.\n\nRowe doubled his tally shortly after the hour with Fylde\u2019s well worked fifth. Bradley did fantastically well to break into the box and his cut-back was placed perfectly into the bottom corner by the Coasters hitman.\n\nKeiran Thomas hit a stinging long range strike in frustration with 20 minutes to go as Gloucester desperately searched for a way back into the contest.\n\nThere was no respite for the hosts backline as Fylde continued to probe, Singh getting in the way of Bradley\u2019s low effort to keep the score down.\n\nHanks had the final chance of the evening when he lined up for a free-kick 25 yards out, but his side-footed attempt was the wrong side of the left-hand post.\n\nManager Dave Challinor was delighted with Fylde\u2019s response after the 4-0 FA Trophy defeat at Brackley in midweek.\n\nChallinor said: \u201cA lot has been said over the last few days after Tuesday night. We felt let down and that we let people down with our performance.\n\n\u201cToday is the completely opposite feeling \u2013 a feeling of pride for every single one of them.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve worked their socks off and we\u2019ve shown what quality we\u2019ve got. We\u2019ve got eight days now to recover for our Boxing Day game.\n\n\u201cGloucester are quite expansive in the way they play and it\u2019s difficult to play against sometimes. After conceding so early, it becomes even more difficult.\n\n\u201cThe goal we got five minutes before half-time allowed us to change the way we played in the second half because we were in front.\n\n\u201c I just felt we were a little bit open, so we made a chance at half-time and said that we\u2019d drop back and let them have possession of the ball.\n\n\u201cWhen you do that, you have to be clinical on the counter-attack and we were scary in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe scored three, could have scored another couple at least and looked really solid defensively.\u201d\n\nDANIEL AGNEW\n\nGloucester: Singh, Thomas, Hall, Kotwica (Hopper 68), Avery, Mullings, Hanks, Webb, Reid (Fitzgibbon 68), Parker (Harding 79), Williams;not used: Richards, Deaman.\n\nAFC Fylde: Taylor, Wilson, Langley, Williams (Collins 62), Kennedy, Bond, C.

    "title": "Peacocks shop means Abingdon town centre will finally stock children's clothes again (From Herald Series)",
    "text": "ABINGDON has welcomed the arrival of a chain store after learning that it will stock children's clothes.\n\nPeacocks is set to move into the former Co-op store in Abingdon's Bury Street.\n\nIt will be the first town centre retailer in seven years to sell clothes for older children.\n\nThe fashion chain told the Abingdon Herald yesterday that it will open later this month with a children's department.\n\nThe company also confirmed there will be an Edinburgh Woollen Mill opening in the same unit.\n\nIan Collett of The Bookstore in Bury Street said: \"I didn't initially think it was what I was hoping for, however it will sell children's clothes which is a really good thing.\n\n\"It's a big empty unit that needs filling and needs to cater for both ladies and gentlemen.\n\n\"We all wanted a top-end destination store but because of where it is situated I'm not sure we ever would have got it.\n\n\"The problem is we have got nowhere to put one.\"\n\nMr Collett said when Superdrug moved across the street it took up the only shop large enough to accommodate a big chain, and was concerned that its old unit opposite Peacocks will struggle to find interest because it has little frontage.\n\nThe last chain store that sold children's clothes in the town centre was Adams which shut in 2009, and there is little currently available for families aside from The Nursery Shop in Stert Street which sells clothes for babies and toddlers.\n\nAbingdon Business Improvement District (BID) leader Julie Downing said the addition of Peacocks was 'absolutely a positive thing'.\n\nShe said: \"It's good to have something in there but it's also a rise in children's clothes, providing a service we haven't actually got. It's filling a space and hopefully making it more attractive.\"\n\nPeacocks has begun work at the empty store which has sat neglected since the Co-op closed last summer.\n\nMrs Downing agreed that the area 'needs a huge refurbishment' and said Vale of White Horse District Council was still 'very much in talks' to update The Charter, which was set for a \u00a350m revamp by owner Aberdeen Asset Management until it pulled out of its agreement with the council earlier this year.\n\nShe said she expected reactions would vary in the town to the news that Peacocks is moving in, adding: \"Some people wanted something more upmarket. But anything is better than nothing and it's not like anything that's already here. It's going to add to business, not take away. It's a larger chain which is positive and will maybe bring other retailers in.\"\n\nThe shop openings will create 13 to 15 new jobs in the town.",

    "title": "14 Learnings from Starting my Own Business",
    "text": "I've often been told by several relatives that from a very young age I used to say that I wanted to run my own business. Now I do, and as the end of the year comes, a time that always instils increased and broader reflection than normal, I was looking back at all that I have learned since starting out this chapter of my journey.\n\nFirstly, owning your own business can be heavily glorified, in fact, many of my family members assumed that I was living the life of luxury, taking trips, working from anywhere, with money flowing in from the very second I said I was running my own business. It is not their fault, they just didn't know that the reality, especially at the start, can be very different. In fact, during the first couple of months, my cousin sent me a text to say congrats that \"I made it\", I sent back a picture of a ramen noodle packet, a bed I had no time to make, and my tired looking face. The truth is, it is hard work and not an easy journey, but I wouldn't change it for a thing. The learnings I have gained, the experiences I have been exposed to, the skills I have grown, and watching something you created and believe in mature and expand is worth every little extra grey hair I seem to now have. Here are just some of my learnings in case they are handy for anyone already in the initial stages, or thinking about starting their own business.\n\nFirst some of the Business Learnings...\n\n1. It is imperative to know enough about each facet of your business. This includes legal, financial, sales...the whole lot. You don't have to be an expert, but knowing just enough to understand what is good for you and the business is wise...no matter how boring it is. Much time is spent signing contracts and negotiating deals so understanding the lingo, what various terms mean, and what to look out for is incredibly useful. Also, understand the full costs associated, this includes the \"costs\" that you didn't worry about before - sick pay, retirement etc. After all, no one looks after your own interests as well as you will.\n\n2. There is no need to go crazy with the spending. Many people focus on spending money on items that really may not be needed - be it crazy office space or filling various roles before they may actually be required. We took the approach of being very cautious with spending. There are so many services you can get today without huge long-contract investment which can help until it is the right time for greater investment. This includes legal, accounting, office space in co-working locations, or skills - there are several ways to access what you need in ways that give you flexibility to increase and decrease should you need to. Just remember to do your research, as the quality can really range.\n\n3. When hiring, be it employees or interns, look for the traits that will enable success. In what we do, I look for curiosity, a passion for understanding humans and technology, an ability to connect the dots and visualize patterns, and other such attributes. The rest, such as methodologies or tools, we can train for.\n\n4. It is incredibly useful to build a solid reputation as an individual in the domain. As the owner, you are a huge part of your company's brand. Brand and reputation management as an individual is important for your business. Customers should believe in you and your knowledge.\n\n5. It is essential to keep learning and pivot as you need. Over the first year we got more and more focused. We learned each time we worked with customers and continuously improved what we do, aligning our strategy better and better. It is key to be experimental as well as strategic, and, to execute on the tactical needs. Sometimes you have one idea but find that the path you end up on leads somewhere else. Or you may just need a refocus of your originally thinking as you flesh out any assumptions you may have made.\n\n6. One thing is for sure: you must deliver true value. Always deliver high quality. Exceed expectations. This is enabled by several factors: setting the right expectations, getting your costing matched to value, consistent delivery of clear value etc. Being known for clear quality, and being great to work with works wonders. Once a client said to us, \"working with you is like having real partners that understand our business, and are actually leaving us in a better place.\" It was one of the best compliments we could have gotten.\n\n7. You cannot do everything yourself. It is handy to have a business partner. This is a special relationship and is not to be taken lightly. Picking someone for whom you have a great level of respect and trust in, and who also has complementary skill sets is a good start. You will see each other at your worst, and your best - they are the ones who can understand what you are going through and who will share the burdens and the successes with you.\n\n8. Be attentive. I have learned that it is highly irritating when people keep telling me how \"busy they are\", how they are \"always working, through their vacations etc.\" yet they couldn't find 30 seconds to email back a response that others are waiting on. Being attentive to the important things is imperative to show your partners and customers that you care. There are so many great mechanisms for handling overload while still maintaining a good level of attentiveness and care for the important communications - you just need to find what works for you. For me, I have some email time in the morning and again in the evening, then I check at times throughout the day, but when I am working on something specific that needs my attention I won't look. I go through the emails that may have come in and if it will take less than 5 minutes to respond then I do, but if it needs much more thought, I'll star it. I then clear out the stars during email time later. I apply logic; if it is a question from a potential or current client, a decision I need to make, or if someone may be affected by my delay, I get to it so that they are not left hanging.\n\nAnd, the Personal Learnings...\n\n9. It is a journey; I dedicate time to continuous learning. Every day I set aside time to read, learn, and stay up to date in my industry and domain.\n\n10. I learned that it was incredibly important to look after yourself - physically, mentally and emotionally. Time to yourself is important - even with family commitments on top. I try to spend some time each day on each. I have had stressful jobs before, but nothing compares to the feelings and emotions you go through on your own business journey.\n\n11. It is not just you in it. Everyone is in it together, your family, your friends, and your partner. They deal with you when you are stressed, annoyed, happy, or frustrated. They pick up the slack when you are focused on that deliverable or closing that deal. Your support structure is everything. They are a huge part of your success; remember to appreciate them.\n\n12. Know it's OK to have a moment. Goodness knows I had a few. Moments where I thought, it would be so much easier to just get a job, get a pay check, and to do things that someone else has organized... but these moments are fleeting. As quick as those thoughts enter my head, they're gone.\n\n13. It's OK to get feedback, ask for help, or not know what to do. I have a group of excellent mentors that all give me fantastic advice, connect me to the right people, and constantly teach me things, then I decide what feels right for me. Building those relationships takes time and effort, but it's worth it. I also love to help others when I can. You don't help others to get something back, but it does seem like good universal karma exists when you do so with a willing heart and no expectations.\n\n14. Be truly energized by what you do. The amount of clients that say the passion is what comes across when we talk to them is incredible. I live and breath Experience Design, I love it. Being passionate can be inspirational and can make others feel positively about the subject at hand. Passion is contagious. While not everything you will need to do is the most exciting, or even things you like to do, having the passion, will help make the journey fun, exciting, and get you through the long hours, stressful nights, and frustrating moments.\n\nI always say to the people that I mentor \"wanting without doing is just wishing\" so go and actively do something that brings you closer to achieving your dreams today! For me, I look forward to all the learnings and experiences still yet to come.\n\nFollow Sarah Deane on Twitter: www.twitter.com/effectUX",

    "text": "Anis Amri, 24, pictured in a new video, offered himself up as a suicide bomber and was also learning how to make bombs, according to security sources\n\nThe Berlin lorry massacre suspect offered himself up as an ISIS suicide bomber and took a sinister video of himself walking the streets of the German capital, it was revealed today.\n\nAnis Amri, 24, was also learning how to make bombs and was barred from flying to America because of his links to ISIS, US officials have revealed.\n\nWire taps revealed that two months ago Amri had told a hate preacher that he was willing to blow himself up - and had also inquired about buying automatic weapons from a police informant.\n\nBut German officers still did not believe they had enough evidence to arrest him, according to Spiegel.\n\nAmri, who had six aliases and three fake passports, also had an array different social media accounts including one where his profile picture was a lion - a key motif used by jihadists to symbolise honour.\n\nIt contains a single video of him filming himself in the centre of Berlin in September - with German media claiming it could have been a reconnaissance video.\n\nPolice today revealed that his fingerprints were found on the door of the hijacked lorry used to murder 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday night.\n\nOfficers have been carrying out raids across Germany as the international manhunt continued for the failed Tunisian asylum seeker with German police under fire for a string of blunders that let him go free.\n\nFour men were arrested in Dortmund - where Amri once lived with a hate preacher. The men have reportedly been held because they know him well,\n\nA flat was also raided in Berlin, but was empty, and a shelter for asylum seekers was searched in Emmerich, eastern Germany, where one man was questioned.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who has a 100,000 euro reward on his head, was under the surveillance of German intelligence for several months following his arrival in the country in 2015. He had been arrested three times this year and his asylum application was rejected - but deportation papers were never served and he disappeared.\n\nOn Monday night, the Tunisian radical - who has used six different aliases and three different nationalities - is believed to have driven a 40-tonne truck through a Christmas market, killing 12 and injuring dozens.\n\nIt has since emerged that he was on the radar of US agencies who say Amri researched bomb-making online and was barred from flying to America having communicated with ISIS using the Telegram messaging service.\n\nThis morning, ahead of the scheduled reopening of the market in Berlin, German officials denied reports that there had been four arrests of people linked to the suspect. But pictures have emerged of raids taking place in the city of Dortmund.\n\nMeanwhile, an Israeli woman, Dalia Elyakim, became the first named victim of the attack. She was standing with her husband Rami when the truck rammed into them.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nPath to Germany: Amri fled Tunisia to avoid jail but was imprisoned in Italy for rioting in an immigration centre. He still managed to get to Germany after his release. He has been repeatedly arrested and watched by vanished two weeks ago\n\nA European arrest warrant from Germany, indicates that Anis Amri (pictured) has at times used six different aliases and three different nationalities.

The protesters had been hitting out at German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the market attack\n\nLast night it emerged that Amri also tried to recruit an accomplice for a terror plot \u2013 which the authorities knew about \u2013 but that he still remained at large.\n\nHe was under investigation for planning a 'serious act of violence against the state' and counter-terrorism officials had exchanged information about him last month.\n\nReports suggest intelligence services might have even lost track of Amri as recently as just a few weeks ago after he went underground.\n\nThe potentially fatal mistakes heaped further shame on the German security services, who wasted several hours questioning an innocent Pakistani asylum seeker in the aftermath of the truck rampage, which killed 12 shoppers and wounded 48.\n\nGerman police are in a desperate race to detain Amri, described as being probably armed and \u2018highly dangerous\u2019 before any further terrorist attack.\n\nThere were reports police had carried out raids on two addresses in Berlin last night but this was later denied by police.\n\nFurther reports emerged this morning that four people with links to the suspect had been detained, but this was also denied.\n\nLast night it emerged Amri spent four years in an Italian prison for acts of violence and vandalism inside a migrant centre where he was being kept following his arrival in Europe. The prison in Palermo, Sicily, is where mafia bosses and gangsters are locked up.\n\nAmri's family, who remain in Tunisia, were questioned by local police as his siblings condemned acts of terrorism, saying Amri 'deserves every condemnation' if he is guilty of the massacre.

Photographs show how he has changed his appearance over the years.\n\nYesterday his family, who remain in Tunisia, were questioned by local police as his siblings condemned acts of terrorism, saying Amri 'deserves every condemnation' if he is guilty of the massacre.\n\nAmri became Europe's most wanted man after his identity papers were found in the footwell of the lorry used in the atrocity.\n\nLast night it emerged that Amri's application for asylum was turned down last summer because he did not possess the correct papers.\n\nCHANGING FACES OF PRIME SUSPECT ANIS AMRI A European arrest warrant issued for Amri reveals the fugitive has used at least six different aliases under three different nationalities. Here, four photographs show how he has changed his appearance over the years:\n\nBut under a peculiarity of the German asylum system he was granted 'toleration' papers allowing him to stay temporarily, for unknown reasons. He was due to be deported before the end of the year.\n\nThe German authorities were in touch with their Tunisian counterparts to get him a passport so he could be sent home. But Tunisia reportedly said it had no record of him being a citizen.\n\nThe country has now been accused of delaying his extradition as it emerged new ID papers only arrived in Germany two days after the carnage.\n\nHe was put on a danger list shortly after arriving in Germany in June last year, which meant authorities considered him prone to extreme violence. Yet just how much surveillance he was under remains unclear.\n\nThe German authorities watched Amri for several months this year to try to determine whether he had planned a robbery to fund the purchase of automatic weapons for a possible attack with accomplices. But the covert surveillance operation ceased after the security services could not prove their suspicions, a judicial source said.\n\nIn July he was arrested for an unknown offence while travelling on a bus to Berlin, and was later charged with assault for a knife fight over drugs. In August he was arrested for possessing a fake Italian document, but again released.\n\nHe had contact with preachers who promoted jihad among young German men who converted to Islam. According to media reports, Amri lived for a time with a hate preacher in Dortmund who is under arrest for his involvement with IS.\n\nHe is also known to have attended hate sermons by Abu Walaa, now in custody after being arrested last month for radicalising young men. The so-called \u2018faceless preacher\u2019 delivered online video sermons with his back to the camera, often draped in a black hood and cloak.\n\nThe preacher, who is believed to have three wives, had 25,000 Facebook followers and even offered his own app in 2014.\n\nWill the lorry killer strike again? Police and the security services are hunting the terrorist behind the Christmas market attack\n\nMourners placed flowers and candles at the site while German flags flew at half-mast and Berlin's landmark Brandenburg Gate was lit in the national colours in honour of the victims\n\nCandles, flowers ans wreathes have been laid near the spot where the lorry was driven in to crowds of people at the market\n\nLink? A Facebook profile in his name shows 'likes' linked to Tunisian terror group Ansar al-Sharia, a Tunisian group with followers linked to extremists who murdered 22 at Tunis' Bardo Museum in March 2015 and then 39 tourists at a beach resort in Sousse\n\nWHO IS ANIS AMRIS? Terror suspect Anis Amri, 24, was born in Tataouine, Tunisia in 1992. The desert town, close to the Libyan border, is a well-known ISIS stronghold. He is understood to have racked up a string of criminal offences - including violent car robberies - before illegally entering Europe with a group of Syrian refugees. A European arrest warrant issued for Amri indicates he uses six different aliases and has three different nationalities. Today Amri's father claimed his son left Tunisia seven years ago and first settled in Italy, where he reportedly spent four years in jail for burning down a school. German records show he arrived in Italy in 2012 and entered Germany last year and there are reports that he may have posed as a minor to sneak his way in. Since his arrival in Germany, Amri, who has a \u20ac100,000 reward on his head, has been arrested at least three times. In June German authorities reportedly tried to deport Amri after learning he was planning a 'serious act of violent subversion,' a source told the Washington Post. Amri is known to have attended German hate sermons by Abu Walaa, an ISIS recruiter who is in jail on remand after being arrested last month for radicalising young men for the terror group. Apparently Walaa wanted to send him to Syria. But he did not want to, preferring instead to formulate plans for an attack in Germany. A Facebook profile in his name shows 'likes' linked to Tunisian terror group Ansar al-Sharia, a Tunisian group with followers linked to extremists who murdered 22 at Tunis' Bardo Museum in March 2015 and then 39 tourists at a beach resort in Sousse. As recently as last month, German authorities raised concerns over Amri's alleged links to Islamic extremists.\n\nApparently Walaa had wanted to send Amri to Syria. But he did not want to, preferring instead to formulate plans for an attack in Germany.\n\nAnother investigator said: 'Supposedly the evidence was not strong enough to arrest him.'\n\nA Facebook profile in his name shows 'likes' linked to Tunisian terror group Ansar al-Sharia, a Tunisian group with followers linked to extremists who murdered 22 at Tunis' Bardo Museum in March 2015 and then 39 tourists at a beach resort in Sousse.\n\nHe was in contact with Islamist militants in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and was known to German security agencies, the state's Interior Minister Ralf Jaeger said.\n\nAs the hunt for Europe's most wanted man continues, it was revealed that:\n\nID belonging to Anis Amri, 21, a Tunisian asylum seeker, is found in the footwell.

Lukasz Urban, a father of one, was found shot dead in its cab. It is not yet clear when he died.\n\nPolice arrested Naved B based on a witness description who say him run a red light but later released their sole suspect because of a lack of evidence.\n\nAngela Merkel faces storm over her asylum policy and admits: ' It would be particularly hard to bear for all of us if it was confirmed that a person committed this crime who asked for protection and asylum in Germany'\n\nYesterday, police raided a migrant shelter in the town of Emmerich, western Germany, where he is believed to have lived.\n\nAmri, who was born in the desert town of Tataouine in 1992 \u2013 a well-known ISIS stronghold close to the Libyan border - is believed to have entered Europe through Italy with Syrian refugees.\n\nHis father told Tunisia's Mosaique FM radio that his son left his homeland about seven years ago, spent four years in a prison in Italy after being accused in a fire at a school there then moved to Germany more than a year ago. Official records suggest he arrived in Italy in 2012 and there are reports that he posed as a minor to sneak his way in to the continent.\n\nCiting security officials, Mosaique FM said Amri had been convicted in absentia for aggravated theft with violence in Tunisia and sentenced to five years in prison. No dates were given.\n\nTunisian anti-terror police interrogated Amri's relatives Wednesday in the central Tunisian town of Oueslatia. It is not known how many family members were present.\n\nPrevious: Amri, who was born in the desert town of Tataouine in 1992 \u2013 a well-known ISIS stronghold close to the Libyan border - was apparently recently arrested for GBH but vanished before he could be charged.

Visitors are pictured sitting around an open fire at the Christmas market in Alexanderplatz\n\nWanted: Amri was living in Berlin but a police operation is now underway in North Rhine-Westphalia - the industrial region of Germany containing Cologne, Dortmund and Bonn\n\nTUNISIA: THE CRUCIBLE OF ISLAMIC TERROR ATTACKS Once Tunisia was renowned for its sunbaked beaches \u2013 now it is notorious for being a crucible of Islamist terror. The emergence of Anis Amri as the prime suspect for the Berlin Christmas market massacre would have come as little surprise to anti-terror chiefs across Europe. The Berlin bloodbath is just the latest in a string of attacks that highlight the role of young Tunisian-born men in orchestrating Islamist terror attacks. On his Facebook account, Amri has expressed his support for a notorious jihadist group in his homeland. Ansar al-Sharia Tunisia is a radical Islamist group numbering about 1,000 people with some linked to the 2015 Sousse beach massacre in the North African country, in which 30 British tourists were killed. The group is ideologically guided by two preachers with British links: one is Abu Qatada, who was deported to Jordon in 2013 after first being arrested on suspicion of terrorism in 2001. The other is a militant Egyptian preacher called Hani al-Sibai, who the Mail exposed last year as living on benefits in the UK. The Berlin attack bears all the hallmarks of the Nice truck attack in July, when Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel killed 86 people during Bastille Day celebrations. Tunisians form the largest contingent of fighters with IS in Syria and Iraq by far, numbering up to 7,000. Many occupy senior positions, including a suspect who lived in Belgium and travelled to Syria who is thought to be the chief planner of the Paris and Brussels attacks. Osama Atar is suspected to be the \u2018Abu Ahmad\u2019 who some of the Paris attackers were in contact with, though Atar has refuted the charge online.\n\nOne of his brothers said Amri deserves 'every condemnation' if he is guilty of the Christmas market massacre.\n\nAbdelkader Amri said the family 'rejects terrorism' and suggested they would cut ties with fugitive brother Anis Amri if he was found to be behind the atrocity.\n\nHe said: 'When I saw the picture of my brother in the media, I couldn't believe my eyes. I'm in shock, and can't believe it's him who committed this crime.'\n\nBut, he added, 'if he's guilty, he deserves every condemnation. We reject terrorism and terrorists - we have no dealings with terrorists'.\n\nSpeaking from his home in Tunisia, another brother, Walid, 30, revealed he had not heard from Anis in two weeks.\n\nTruck driver Walid said Anis first left Tunisia for Italy in 2011 but 'always wanted to go on to Germany to find work. Three or for years later he managed that.'\n\nHis brother added: 'He told me often that he couldn't find a flat In Germany and was sleeping here and there. But during our last contact two weeks ago he said everything was good with him.\n\n'He comes from a family of nine children and always sent money back to us. I don't know where it came from. We live as a struggling family, we live a totally normal life.'\n\nHe said he last communicated with his brother over Facebook two weeks ago and does not have a mobile number for the fugitive.\n\n'We are as shocked as everyone else in the world,' he added. 'We have no contact to Isis. I only learned my brother was being hunted over Facebook. I am affected the same as everyone else by this news.'\n\nSister Najoua said: 'I was the first to see his picture and it came as a total shock. I can't believe my brother could do such a thing.\n\n'He never made us feel there was anything wrong. We were in touch through Facebook and he was always smiling and cheerful.'\n\nDespite an unfolding international manhunt the first pictures released of Amri in Germany showed his eyes deliberately covered, thought to be because of strict privacy laws there.\n\nPolice are believed to have found blood in the truck's cab and now assume that the suspect may be badly injured.\n\nSquads of officers have been to every hospital in Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg. They also arrested another unnamed suspect in connection with the terror attack but have since ruled him out.\n\nAmri was living in Berlin but a police operation is now underway in North Rhine-Westphalia - the industrial region of Germany containing Cologne, Dortmund and Bonn. His ID was issued on the town of Kleve close to the border with the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nThe atrocity could be a political disaster for Mrs Merkel, who will seek a historic fourth term as chancellor next year. She has staked much of her political capital on opening Germany's doors to refugees.\n\nHE'S ON THE RUN - BUT PROTECTING HIS PRIVACY PREVENTS HIS PHOTO BEING SHOWN IN GERMANY Despite an unfolding international manhunt the first pictures of Amri released in Germany have his eyes deliberately covered, thought to be because of strict privacy laws there. MailOnline has uncovered unblurred images By Julian Robinson An international manhunt is underway for the new prime suspect in the Berlin Christmas market massacre - but in pictures released in Germany, the Tunisian's eyes are, bizarrely, obscured with a black bar. The 21-year-old's ID was found under the seat in the lorry used to murder 12 people and maim dozens of others. Yet strict privacy rules in Germany mean newspapers in the country are referring to him only by his first name and the first initial of his last surname - despite a public appeal aimed at tracking him down. Pictures of Anis A, who if he is the driver police believe is probably armed, 'highly dangerous' and a member of a 'large' Islamic organisation, are also partially obscured, blocking out his eyes. Media used the same naming method for Naved Baluch yesterday when the Pakistani was held in the aftermath of the atrocity. The 24-year-old, who arrived in Germany a year ago, was blamed for Monday night's carnage but released 18 hours later. In line with the country's privacy laws, German authorities will not fully name anyone they arrest over the atrocity. It is not the first example of full names being withheld during criminal cases in the country. Last month, only first names were released as two Syrian men, Kamel T.H.J. and Azad R., were charged with membership in a terrorist organisation on allegations they fought with a militant Islamist groups in their homeland. A month earlier, a similar tactic was employed on the arrest of suspected ISIS airport bomb plotter Jaber al-Bakr. The 22-year-old, had built 'a virtual bomb-making lab' in a flat in Chemnitz and was thought to have planned an attack against either one of Berlin's two airports or a transport hub in his home state of Saxony, security sources said. He later hanged himself in his prison cell - despite being on suicide watch. Some newspapers even keep to the rule when referring to Austrian monster Josef Fritzl, who repeatedly raped his daughter, Elisabeth, and fathered seven children by her while keeping her imprisoned in his cellar for 24 years.\n\nThis afternoon, a wanted notice revealed the Berlin attack suspect should be considered armed and dangerous.\n\nThe notice, a European arrest warrant from Germany, indicates he has at times used six different aliases and three different nationalities.\n\nIt names Anis Amri as having Tunisian citizenship, born in the town of Ghaza. But it lists multiple aliases, many of them variants on his name, and Egyptian and Lebanese citizenship as well.\n\nAmri's home town in north Africa is famous for being the inspiration for Luke Skywalker's home planet in Star Wars but has become an ISIS stronghold for jihadis attacking targets in nearby Libya.\n\nIt came as it was revealed the Pakistani asylum seeker held in the aftermath of the Berlin Christmas market massacre was held because he accidentally jumped a red light.\n\nNaved Baluch, 24, who arrived in Germany a year ago, was seized and blamed for Monday night's carnage after witnesses saw him commit a traffic offence a mile away.\n\nDetectives, who flew him out of Berlin and across the country to Karlsruhe to question him, took 18 hours to realise Mr Baluch, who had no blood on his clothes and no injuries, did not drive a lorry through crowds to kill 12 and wound 48 more.\n\nIt was only then the security services warned the public that the real ISIS killer was on the run with a gun. Today Berlin is in mourning as police warned 'vigilance' is needed because a second attack could be imminent.\n\nDespite bungling the initial investigation police insist DNA, GPS and mobile phone data tied to the lorry used to murder and maim could lead to an arrest.\n\nBerlin detectives have revealed that have had 500 calls from the public since Monday night's massacre.\n\nProbe: Naved B, a Pakistani asylum seeker, had been detained in the immediate aftermath of the carnage following a tip-off from witnesses who saw him jump a light (pictured with a blanket over his head). However he was released last night due to a lack of evidence\n\nRing of steel: Armed police continue to guard the Christmas market where 12 were killed on Monday night\n\nCarnage: The area is cordoned off as a crime scene and debris left by the careering lorry remains sprayed across the pavement\n\nPrayers: Berliners cry and pray at the piles of flowers and candles left to remember the 12 dead and up to 48 injured after being hit by a careering lorry\n\nWAS PETTY CRIMINAL RADICALISED IN A JAIL CELL? By Mario Ledwith, Emily Kent Smith and Emine Sinmaz for the Daily Mail As a teenager growing up in a poor part of Tunisia, Anis Amri spent his evenings chasing girls, drinking alcohol and indulging in petty thieving. He had apparently grown apart from the Muslim faith that played a central role in his childhood. But a scrape with the law after making the perilous journey to Europe aged 18 with a group of Syrian refugees saw him embrace religion once again. Relatives yesterday revealed how Europe\u2019s most wanted man began praying in a possible act of desperation as he spent four years in Italy largely locked up in jail. It was then that his journey into the dark world of extremism is thought to have begun, which led to him fraternising with notorious hate preachers. One of nine children, he grew up on an estate in the small town of Oueslatia in northern Tunisia\u2019s Kairouan province. Speaking from Tunisia yesterday, the fugitive\u2019s brother Walid insisted that his sibling was a \u2018calm and nice\u2019 man when he left for Europe in 2011 in search of work. But his behaviour apparently changed after he was jailed in Italy shortly after arriving the following year. \u2018We went to mosque when we were younger and then Anis started to drink alcohol when he was a teenager and he had girlfriends,\u2019 Walid said. \u2018My brother changed after he was released from the Italian prison. Before he was drinking and he had a girlfriend, but after he was released his life became secret. He told me when he was in Italy that he was praying again.\u2019 His lengthy spell in an Italian jail housing mafia bosses and gangsters was for smashing up a migrant centre. Amri, now 24, crossed the border into Germany in July 2015 following his release, and tried to maintain a low profile. He was known to German security officials, who were yesterday forced to reveal how a series of errors allowed him to slip through the net. He was arrested in Germany three times this year alone, local media reported. And despite being refused asylum in July, he was given temporary permission to stay until the end of the year. It is thought the hold-up was because Tunisian officials denied he was a citizen there. Documents proving that he was Tunisian only arrived in Germany yesterday. Amri went by at least six different names and claimed to be from both Egypt and Lebanon. One of his many German homes was an asylum centre in Emmerich, North Rhine-Westphalia, which was yesterday raided by police. His Facebook profile revealed links to Ansar al-Sharia, a Tunisian terror group connected to the 2015 Sousse beach attack that left 38 dead. He is also believed to have known Abu Walaa, an Iraqi fanatic known as \u2018the faceless preacher\u2019 as he has delivered video sermons with his back to the camera. Relatives said they had not heard from Amri for 15 days.\n\nThe probe centres on the GPS system of the truck may be linked to the mobile telephone of the killer. Fingerprint evidence was also garnered from the cab of the wrecked lorry.\n\nProsecutor Holger M\u00fcnch warned of another significant attack. And interior minister Klaus Bouillon declared Germany was 'in a state of war'.\n\nWithin hours of the release of Mr Baluch, ISIS issued its first claim of responsibility for the lorry attack on festive shoppers and revellers.\n\nIn a statement, the group's AMAQ news agency said: 'The executor of the operation in Berlin is a soldier of the Islamic State and he executed the operation in response to calls to target nationals of the coalition countries.'\n\nThe killer hijacked a juggernaut laden with steel to carry out the attack. The lorry's computer system recorded a series of stop-start manoeuvres 'as if someone was learning how to drive'.\n\nPolice stand by a currywurst stand at the scene in the Christmas market where the attacks took place\n\nResidents gathered at the Brandenburg Gate last night, which was lit in the colours of the German flag in tribute to the dead\n\nThe site of the terror attack in the centre of Berlin was last night transformed into a shrine to those who lost their lives\n\nHorror 2016: These are all the terror attacks carried out on German soil in the past year, claiming the lives of 22 people\n\nAt 7pm local time it drove around the Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz Square several times, as if to build up speed, before switching off its headlights and charging at 40mph into a crowd.\n\nVictims including children were sent flying like bowling pins and crushed under the 25-ton HGV's wheels. The driver jumped from the cab and raced from the bloodbath.\n\nAlready dead in the cabin was the lorry's driver, Lukasz Urban, a 37-year-old father of one from Poland who had been transporting steel beams to Germany from Italy.\n\nHe was found beaten and shot with a single bullet fired from a pistol. His cousin and boss said it was 'really clear that he was fighting for his life'. The gun has not been found.\n\nThe attacker was followed by a witness for a mile and a half \u2013 updating police on his mobile phone \u2013 but who is then said to have lost him in the city's Tiergarten park.\n\nOn the basis of the description of the attacker given to police by the witness, officers pounced on Mr Baluch near the park's victory column.\n\nPolice celebrated the swift arrest, with spokesman Winfrid Wenzel hailing the 'civic courage' of the witness. But relief later turned to helplessness as the authorities admitted they had been wasting their time with the Pakistani, whose DNA was not in the cab.\n\nOverhead: This is a clear view of the path the lorry took through the now-destroyed Christmas market in central Berlin\n\nClose up: The shattered glass on the windshield of a truck shown after it ploughed through the Christmas market.

He was living in a hangar at the old Tempelhof airport in the middle of Berlin, which police commandos raided at 4am yesterday in search of clues and accomplices.\n\nThis morning Israeli woman Dalia Elyakim became the first named victim of the massacre.\n\nElyakim, from Herzliya, Israel, was with her husband Rami as the truck rampaged through wooden stalls at the market on Monday night in an attack that claimed 12 lives.\n\nOne of the other fatalities could be Italian Fabrizia Lorenzo, 31, a transport specialist whose mobile phone and travel pass were found in the crash zone.\n\nOf the wounded, 25 are still in hospital \u2013 18 of whom have 'very serious injuries'. Twenty-four others have been discharged. The rest were walking wounded. Last night thousands of mourners including people caught up in the attack held a candlelit vigil at the scene.\n\nSara Dobler, 26, from Port Talbot in Wales, witnessed the attack, saying: 'One guy was on the floor, lying there trying to get up, but his head injury was quite severe so I just held his hand, told him everything is going to be OK.\n\n'I don't know how he is now but I hope he's OK. It was as if we were in a horror film.\n\nTUNISIAN TRUCK SUSPECT'S DEPORTATION PAPERS ARRIVE TWO DAYS AFTER BERLIN TERROR ATTACK A German regional minister Wednesday accused Tunisia of delaying for months the extradition of a man now wanted over the Berlin market attack, saying required papers had only just arrived, two days after the carnage. The asylum request launched by the man hunted by police, identified by media as Anis Amri had been rejected in June, said Ralf Jaeger, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state. 'But the man could not be deported because he had no valid travel documents,' said Jaeger. 'The procedure for drawing up a document in lieu of a passport was initiated in August, but Tunisia disputed the fact that this person was one of its nationals,' he added. German security sources blamed Tunisian officials for failing to supply documents to allow the deportation of Anis Amri, pictured Amri is the chief suspect in Monday's fatal truck attack in Berlin and a \u20ac100,000 reward has been offered for his immediate capture Only after a months-long wait - during which German security services investigated the man for a suspected attack plan - Tunisia came through with the papers, Jaeger told a press conference. Finally, the new Tunisian travel document 'arrived today' in Germany, two days after the Berlin Christmas market attack. Germany has repeatedly accused Tunisia and other Maghreb states of stalling on the repatriation of its nationals from Germany. The subject sparked tensions after the mass sexual assaults in the German city of Cologne, blamed largely on North African and Arab men, last New Year's Eve. Germany this year moved to declare Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco as so-called safe countries of origin, to raise the bar for asylum requests. But the bill has been stuck in the upper house for months over human rights concerns in those nations.\n\n'We tried to get people, mainly families with children, to move away from the area because we didn't want them to see what we saw. It is traumatising.'\n\nThe atrocity could be a political disaster for Mrs Merkel, who will seek a historic fourth term as chancellor next year. She has staked much of her political capital on opening Germany's doors to refugees.\n\nHorst Seehofer, the minister-president of Bavaria and one of the harshest critics of her open-door asylum policy, caused a storm Tuesday night when he said on TV: 'We owe it to the victims, to those affected and to the whole population to rethink our immigration and security policy and to change it.'\n\nThere were fresh questions yesterday over whether more could have been done to prevent the attacks.\n\nEuropol, the European Union police intelligence agency, warned earlier this month that lone attackers or small cells were plotting mayhem using vehicles as weapons.\n\nEuropol also pointed to reports that German authorities were aware of hundreds of attempts by jihadists to recruit refugees.\n\nIn November the United States warned its citizens it had 'credible information' that the Christmas markets were a target, while in the UK, the Foreign Office revised its travel advice earlier this month saying there was a 'high threat from terrorism' in Germany.\n\nISIS militants had even published a terror manual last month containing instructions on using a lorry to inflict maximum carnage.\n\nTheir chilling Rumiyah magazine said using a vehicle was one of the most successful ways of 'harvesting' large numbers of non-believers.\n\nYet in Berlin, no concrete bollards were in place to protect revellers, with the authorities saying it would be wrong to turn the famous markets into 'fortresses'.\n\nLukasz Urban (pictured), a 37-year-old father-of-one, was killed in the carnage that saw a 25-tonne truck career through Berlin's Breitscheidplatz Square, which killed 12 and injured dozens more\n\nFabrizia Lorenzo, pictured, 30, is a transport specialist working in Berlin but her cousin said they had not heard from her since last night\n\nThis morning Israeli woman Dalia Elyakim became the first named victim of the massacre. Elyakim, from Herzliya, Israel, was with her husband Rami as the truck rampaged through wooden stalls at the market on Monday night in an attack that claimed 12 lives\n\nA young student from Spain survived the terror with multiple broken bones but his life intact.\n\nInaki Ellakuria from Bilbao was at the Christmas market with three female friends when the truck-terrorist struck. I\u00f1aki, 21, an Erasmus student, was walking with his pals when the lorry hit the shoppers and the flimsy Christmas huts.\n\nHe remembers the lorry shedding a tyre before he was struck. The Berlin School of Economics and Law student suffered multiple fractures - a broken leg in three places and broken bones in his foot.",

    "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating an incident in which a passenger jet was given wrong directions by traffic controllers and guided toward the San Gabriel Mountains, where it flew just hundreds of feet higher than the peak of Mt. Wilson before turning around, according to publicly available flight data.\n\nBound for Taiwan, the EVA Air Boeing 777 took off to the east early Friday from Los Angeles International Airport\u2019s south runway complex, according to FAA spokesman Ian Gregor. After takeoff, the air crew switched from the LAX control tower to the approach control operations in San Diego, which Gregor said was common practice.\n\n\u201cThe air traffic controller at the approach control who was handling EVA instructed the pilot to make a left turn to a 180-degree heading,\u201d he said. \u201cShe meant to tell the pilot to make a right turn to a 180-degree heading.\u201d\n\nFollowing the controller\u2019s instructions, the pilot turned left.\n\nThe move sent the plane in the wrong direction, Gregor said.\n\nInstead of flying south, the aircraft flew north toward the San Gabriel Mountains and an Air Canada jet that had departed from the north runway complex at LAX.\n\nWhen the controller realized the mistake, she \u201ctook immediate action to keep EVA safely separated\u201d from the second aircraft as well as ground terrain, Gregor said. She issued the EVA pilot a series of instructions to help him turn south.\n\n\u201cThe controller wanted to make sure the EVA aircraft was safely above or away from nearby terrain,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conversation between the pilot of EVA 015 and the controller was posted by VASAviation on Youtube. At one point during the flight, the controller asks the pilot, \u201cWhat are you doing? Turn southbound now.\u201d\n\nA graphic depiction of the aircraft\u2019s flight path, altitude and speed on the website Flightradar24.com shows the plane turning north and flying over Pasadena toward the San Gabriel Mountains. Just five minutes after takeoff, the plane is hovering 5,000 feet over Eaton Canyon when it begins turning away from the mountain range and heading south.\n\nAs the aircraft banks directly to the south of Mt. Wilson, it continues to gain altitude and appears to fly between 500 and 800 feet higher than the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which stands roughly 5,710 feet high, according to the website data. The aircraft\u2019s lateral distance from the mountain peak appears to be between 500 and 600 meters.\n\nIn a statement issued Tuesday, EVA Air said, \u201cOur flight was never too close to other aircraft or to the mountains.\u201d\n\nThe pilot of the aircraft was directed to take off from Runway 7 and complied with the air traffic controller\u2019s direction and speed instructions.\n\n\u201cEVA is working in full cooperation with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and related authorities in the investigation of this situation,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFAA regulations require that airliners be separated by at least 3 miles laterally, or 1,000 feet vertically. The regulations also require airliners to be at least 3 miles away laterally or 2,000 feet vertically above obstacles such as mountains.\n\nAsked whether the aircraft had violated those restrictions, Gregor said the FAA was looking into how high the aircraft was flying above the ground northeast of the airport.\n\nAt least one Altadena resident reported hearing the low-flying plane, KABC-TV reported.\n\n\u201cThe question is how close did they come to the terrain?\u201d said Jon Russell, an air transport pilot and the Western-Pacific regional safety coordinator for the Air Line Pilots Assn. \u201cDid a terrain warning sound in the cockpit?\u201d\n\nFAA officials said Tuesday afternoon that they did not know whether such a warning occurred.\n\nThe flight had 353 people on board, including five infants, an airline spokeswoman said.\n\nveronica.rocha@latimes.com\n\nFor breaking news in California, follow @VeronicaRochaLA on Twitter.\n\nALSO\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court halts voter-approved death penalty measure\n\nL.A.'s highest-ranking African American officer to head scandal-plagued SFPD\n\nPerson detained in disappearance of former bridal reality TV show contestant\n\nUPDATES:\n\n6:10 p.m.: This article was updated with the number of passengers on board.\n\n4:50 p.m.: This article was updated with information on flight communications.\n\n3:55 p.m.: This article was updated with new details on the airplane\u2019s flight path and comments from EVA.\n\nThis article was originally published at 2:10 p.m.",

    "title": "RBI\u2019s latest figures on new notes supplied to the public is a mathematical impossibility",
    "text": "In its latest press release on Wednesday, the RBI said it had sent out for distribution to the public 22.6 billion notes of various denomination worth Rs 5.93 lakh crore. (Reuters)\n\nDespite much criticism, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has failed to give a credible account of the new notes supplied to the public.\n\nIn its latest press release on Wednesday, the RBI said it had sent out for distribution to the public 22.6 billion notes of various denomination worth Rs 5.93 lakh crore.\n\nBut the break-up given, taken with its earlier statements, shows that the RBI\u2019s latest update is a mathematical impossibility.\n\nIndeed, the gap between what the apex bank claims it has disbursed and what, according to its own earlier numbers, it could possibly have disbursed, has now grown to over Rs 66,000 crore.\n\nThis is assuming that 10 per cent of the high denomination notes distributed are of Rs 500 variety. But even if we assume the highly unlikely scenario that all the notes supplied by the RBI were of Rs 2,000 denomination, the math does not add up \u2014 the shortfall would be around Rs 34,000 crore.\n\nDespite attempts to seek clarity, the RBI has not responded to IANS\u2019 queries.\n\nOn December 7, during the monetary policy press conference, the Deputy Governor of RBI, R. Gandhi, informed the media that a total of Rs 4 trillion or Rs 4 lakh crore had been disbursed to the public in new currency notes till the day before.\n\nOf this amount, Rs 1.06 lakh crore in value or 19.1 billion pieces were in smaller denomination currency notes while the rest \u2014 Rs 2.94 lakh crore \u2014 was by way of high-denomination notes of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500.\n\nYou May Also Want To Watch:\n\nOn December 12, the RBI Deputy Governor told reporters that 21.8 billion pieces of notes were issued to the public till December 10, worth Rs 4.61 trillion or Rs 4.61 lakh crore. The next day, an RBI release on the deputy governor\u2019s statement said that 20.1 billion pieces of small notes from Rs 10 to Rs 100 were circulated, while the higher denomination notes amounted to 1.7 billion (or 170 crore) pieces.\n\nAn earlier IANS report showed, as below, that the RBI math did not add up.\n\nAccording to the RBI, the increase in small notes between December 6 and December 10 was only one billion pieces (from 19.1 billion to 20.1 billion). Even if all the small notes printed were of Rs 100 denomination, it takes the value of small notes to Rs 1.16 lakh crore (from Rs 1.06 lakh crore) leaving Rs 3.45 lakh crore to be covered by high denomination notes of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500.\n\nAssuming that only 10 per cent of the total 1.7 billion high denomination notes (170 million or 17 crore) were in Rs 500 notes, its total value (17 crore x 500) amounts to Rs 8,500 crore. Rest of the 90 per cent (1.53 billion or 153 crore) of Rs 2,000 notes amounts to (153 crore x 2,000) Rs 3.06 lakh crore The value of these two high denomination notes amount to Rs 3.14 lakh crore.\n\nThat leaves a gap of Rs 31,000 crore to be covered, which finds no explanation in any of the RBI\u2019s statements.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the latest RBI statement on December 21.\n\nIn this, the RBI says that 22.6 billion currency notes worth Rs 5.93 lakh crore were issued to the public by December 19. Of this, small notes upto Rs 100 denomination were 20.4 billion pieces (2,040 crore pieces) and the rest, 2.2 billion pieces (220 crore pieces) were of higher denomination of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500.\n\nLet\u2019s do the calculation based on this claim.\n\nThe RBI had said earlier that by December 10, the smaller notes upto Rs 100 in circulation were 20.1 billion. The latest statement thus adds just 0.3 billion (30 crore pieces) to the smaller notes in nine days, till December 19. For the higher denomination of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500, the total notes go up from 1.7 billion pieces to 2.2 billion pieces, thus adding 0.5 billion pieces (50 crore pieces).\n\nEven if all the small notes supplied after December 10 were of Rs 100 denomination, it takes the value of small notes to Rs 1.19 lakh crore on December 19 (up from Rs 1.16 lakh crore on December 10) leaving Rs 4.74 lakh crore to be covered by high denomination notes of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500.\n\nLet us again assume that only 10 per cent of the total 2.2 billion high denomination notes (220 million or 22 crore) were in Rs 500 notes. It\u2019s total value (22 crore x 500) amounts to Rs 11,000 crore. Rest of the 90 per cent (1.98 billion or 198 crore) of Rs 2,000 notes amounts to (198 crore x 2,000) Rs 3.96 lakh crore.\n\nThe two high denomination notes together amount to Rs 4.07 lakh crore (Rs 3.96 lakh crore + Rs 11,000 crore), leaving a gap of Rs 66,713 crore.\n\nHow does the RBI explain this continuing discrepancy?\n\nThe ten per cent assumption is not without basis. In response to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the Minister of State for Finance, Arjun Ram Meghwal, said that till November 29, 156 million pieces (15.6 crore) of Rs 500 and 1,608 million pieces (160.8 crore) of Rs 2,000 had been supplied. The Rs 500 notes amount to about 8.85 per cent of the higher denomination notes.\n\nThe Parliament reply is the only place where the government has given a break up of the high denomination notes supplied. The RBI has never given this break up \u2014 and that\u2019s where the problem lies.",

    "title": "Property Watch: Not everything can be 'unique'",
    "text": "Property Watch: Not everything can be 'unique'\n\n'Unique' has become a much-abused word that is thrown around in Phuket's property market. Photo: Peggy_Marco\n\nPHUKET: No other word suffers as much abuse in the Phuket property market as the word \u0091unique\u2019, to the extent that the misuse itself is almost unique.\n\n\n\nThe word is important for property investors, because the \u0091Unique Selling Point\u2019 is a factor that ought to be addressed at an early stage of investment. However, items that are not unique could sell well if they were commodities. But property in Phuket, while in greater demand from prospective residents, is still a long way from being a commodity. Investment into the property market is often a test by a new investor, a belief in Phuket\u2019s future or a punt on capital appreciation, while other markets appear to hit a flattish ceiling combined with unattractive \u0091cooling measure\u2019 taxes.\n\n\n\nWhen I see the words \u0091unique location\u2019 in property ads and brochures, I always wonder what that means, and whether investors are paying attention or care about correct usage of the word.\n\n\n\nFor instance, it is unique not to have to sit in a series of traffic jams for half an hour or more on your way to a destination? It is also unique to have an uninterrupted sea view, as most properties in Phuket don\u2019t have one due to the inevitable geographical and building permit limitations.\n\n\n\nLooking at comparable resort based property markets in Europe, the US, South America, Australia and the Caribbean, it is now easy to see that many offerings are not unique. \u0091Near a golf course\u2019 isn\u2019t unique considering the number of courses dotted around all of these destinations. In a developed area, being near \u0091the school\u2019 isn\u2019t unique if there are plenty of schools to choose from. Being part of an \u0091exclusive gated community\u2019 isn\u2019t unique anymore; there are hundreds of those.\n\n\n\nThese days, Phuket is no longer \u0091unique\u2019 in terms of any single offering. What makes it unique now is the combinations it has to offer and the environment in which it is offering those. You can have a locally flavored Southern Thai meal overlooking Phuket from the hills in Phuket Town, and the next day you can have a great steak with the meat sourced from meat lovers\u2019 paradise. You can live near a golf course and a marina, and keep your golf clubs on your boat.\n\n\n\nPhuket\u2019s uniqueness, in my opinion still exists, and still helps prop up a sometimes unimaginative majority property market. I concede that this is certainly not true of all developers and professionals. To maintain this unique selling point, a collective effort of all those involved in it to preserve its uniqueness will be required. We should celebrate when investors create new attractions, build new malls, expand golf courses and build new roadways, making the combination of uniqueness more convenient.\n\n\n\nI see that successful businesses in Phuket and Thailand have tapped into the gaps really well. I can now order my cheese from cheesemakers in Hua Hin or Pattaya, have it packed in dry ice and delivered to my door. The people who made this happen are innovators.\n\n\n\nInnovation is an economic marker of advanced development and I really hope it continues in Phuket. I hope we all do that, and without sounding too \u0091socialist\u2019, we can do that as a team.

    "text": "Property Inspector: Make outdoor furniture last longer\n\nIf left alone, teak's golden brown color will change to a lustrous silver-grey within a year. Photo: Line Omey\n\nPHUKET: Outdoor furniture can be a sizable investment even here in Thailand. In Phuket it\u2019s either the hot sun or rain adding to deterioration. With proper care and cleaning, you can enjoy your outdoor furniture for years.\n\n\n\nNew furniture comes with care instructions; however this is not always the case in Thailand. So here\u2019s a quick reference to help you maintain your outdoor furniture.\n\n\n\nOutdoor furniture is available in many materials: wicker, wood or teak wood, fabric, aluminum, iron, steel and resin. Each material requires different maintenance methods.\n\n\n\nMonthly cleaning and maintenance can keep the furniture looking good for longer and make your investment last longer too.\n\n\n\nYou can clean most furniture with soap and water. A pressure washer is useful for cleaning many types of outdoor furniture, but you must remember to use a low setting. A pressure washer is not recommended for most wood furniture.\n\n\n\nTeak is the first choice for long lasting furniture and its durability makes it a favorite for patio and deck furniture. Like many tropical hardwoods, teak is saturated with a hard waxy oil substance that protects the wood from bugs, disease, mold and the effects of weather and the sun. This protective oil greatly reduces the damaging effects of weather over the years but does not completely eliminate aging. If left alone, teak\u2019s golden brown color will change to a lustrous silver-grey within a year.\n\n\n\nMany products are available that will preserve the beauty of your teak patio furniture but it\u2019s very important to pick the right one. Some products called \u0091teak oil\u2019 are suitable for indoor teak furniture but may actually promote growth of mold. If you choose to treat your teak furniture, choose high-quality teak oil and make sure the product is intended for use on outdoor teak furniture.\n\n\n\nIn Thailand we have found it is best to apply the teak oil every three to six months depending how much sun your furniture receives. Follow these steps for oiling to get the best results:\n\nClean the furniture with soapy water, rinsing with a garden hose or a teak cleaner.\n\n\n\nEnsure your teak furniture is completely dry before applying the oil, as moisture trapped within the wood may cause black mildew spots to appear after oiling. Your furniture may take up to a couple of days to dry out fully after cleaning or rain. For a smoother finish sand lightly with fine sand paper.\n\n\n\nEnsure the teak is clean and free of dust. For outdoor furniture use high quality teak oil.\n\nFor a super smooth finish, apply two or three times and sand between layers with fine sandpaper. Teak oil will trap dirt and darken with age. Should this occur, scrub and preferably sand to remove old oil and then re-coat.\n\n\n\nWicker furniture can be cleaned using a hose or pressure washer. Simply remove the cushions and spray off dirt and spills. If it\u2019s really dirty, use a sponge and mild soap along with cold water to wash. Allow the furniture to dry completely then apply a paste wax to the frame to keep it shiny and weather resistant. Apply every three to six months.\n\n\n\nAluminum, wrought iron and steel frames can be cleaned with water and mild soap. Many modern frames are rust-resistant or rust free but if your metal furniture is not rust resistant then paste wax can be used to protect it from corroding or rusting. Apply every three to six months.\n\nAs there are so many second homes in Phuket, this is another item your Property Management Company should have on their list to maintain.\n\n\n\nMark Dietrich is a professional inspector and property builder with a Master's degree in building engineering.

    "title": "The New Nature Movement, After 11/8",
    "text": "Our story -- our shared yearning to reconnect children to the natural world -- represents one of the few concerns in America that brings people together across partisan and religious lines.\n\nTo change a society, as the philosopher Ivan Illich wrote, \"you must tell a more powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into our future so that we can take the next step...\"\n\nSo, today, how do we shine that light?\n\nWe must continue to support the birthright of all children to a healthy environment and a connection to the natural world, and to teach the responsibilities that come with that right.\n\nWe can work to reduce climate disruption and the biodiversity collapse by opposing policies that destroy people and the rest of nature, and by making the case that human beings protect what they love and love only what they know. More than ever, building a future generation of conservationists will depend on helping children and adults fall in love with the natural world.\n\nWe can emphasize the healing powers of the natural world: for mental and physical health, for the capacity to learn and create, and for the reduction of violence. We can promote family nature clubs, and similar approaches, as ways to seek meaning and solace in a difficult and alienating time. We can offer a little Vitamin N for the soul through places of worship. And we can encourage pediatricians, psychologists and other healthcare professionals to prescribe nature.\n\nWe can pursue \"natural cultural capacity,\" illuminating the wealth of ways that different cultures connect to nature. We can reach out to people in the food movement, to community organizing groups in urban and rural neighborhoods, to military families and immigrant organizations.\n\nWe can create and renew nature-rich cities to serve as incubators of biodiversity and habitats of health. Local institutions, such as libraries, zoos, aquaria, and nature centers, can become centers of bioregional awareness and nature-connection for children and families. We can help build a new generation of nature-based schools, increase the number and quality of natural schoolyards, and redouble our efforts to honor Natural Teachers as individual agents of change. With the support of education and business, we can nurture the development of careers that connect people to nature, new jobs irreplaceable by technology.\n\nAnd as the human species continues to urbanize, we can strengthen our international efforts. We can seek solidarity in a movement that will grow, regardless of national politics. Worldwide, we can tell a new story of a nature-rich future to counter the post-apocalyptic vision of the future so widely accepted even before 11/8.\n\nHere is what we cannot do: heal every hurt or prevent every tragedy. But surely, in the words of the poet Aeschylus, we can do what we can, in the limited lifetime we have, to \"tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.\"\n\nPolitics can destroy the story, or our story can transcend politics.\n\n________________________\n\nRichard Louv is co-founder and chairman emeritus of the Children & Nature Network.

    "title": "Google Pixel review: the best Android experience around",
    "text": "During the #madebyGoogle event on October 4, Google presented two new Android smartphones, the Pixel and the Pixel XL, putting an official end to the Nexus line. This change of heart had one main reason, which has been repeated more than once by the Mountain View company: they want to have complete control over the hardware manufacturing of their phones. In our review, we take a closer look at the Pixel, the smaller version of the two smartphones with a 5-inch screen, one that we are sure will attract potential buyers who are looking for a more \u201ccompact\u201d phone. Android 7.0 Nougat update: overview for smartphones and tablets\n\nGoogle and its fight for hardware independence\n\nHighlight recent changes Yes No\n\nRating\n\nGood \u2713 Best Android experience\n\n\u2713 Excellent camera\n\n\u2713 Very good performance\n\n\u2713 Unlimited cloud storage for high definition pictures\n\n\u2713 Mini headphone jack\n\n\u2713 Google Support service \"Care by Google\" Bad \u2715 Unspectacular design\n\n\u2715 Not water resistant\n\n\u2715 No microSD card slot\n\n\u2715 Not available worldwide\n\nLowest price: Google Pixel Best price $ 899 . 99 Read Amazon customer reviews Check Offer\n\nGoogle Pixel design and build quality The Google Pixel, with its 5-inch display, is in some ways the successor to the Nexus 5X from last year. With this in mind, you can really see a nice style evolution from last year\u2019s Google smartphone. In fact, it is probably one of the nicest smartphones Google has produced since the Nexus 4 in 2012, however, it certainly isn\u2019t the best-looking model available on the Android market. And for the price, I would have expected more from Google. The Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7, its main market competitors and the ones we compare it with the most, are much more elegant when it comes to design. That being said, it doesn\u2019t mean that the build is better. Google mixes metal and glass on the Pixel. \u00a9 AndroidPIT The Pixel offers a classic design. With its complete metal design, aside from a portion of the rear that is covered in glass, it\u2019s definitely got style. Though the smartphone isn\u2019t very thin, I wouldn\u2019t judge this negatively seeing as it keeps the camera lens from protruding outside of the phone chassis, creating a long elegant line. Not only that, there is also room for a mini headphone jack, a feature that other manufacturers are slowly eliminating. The bottom bezel is a very large and provides no added usage. \u00a9 AndroidPIT What I found to be a bit off-putting was the curiously light weight of the phone. Google, it seems, has managed to reduce the weight in all components of the phone, which makes the phone a lot lighter than we expect it to be. Google and HTC constructed the corners in way that makes the phone not only comfortable to hold, but also easy to pick up off a flat surface. The sides are slightly angled, making it easy to grip the phone. At the top of the front of the phone, you will find the speakers for phone calls. To the left of this just above the display is the front-facing camera lens of 8 MP and the motion sensor. And although there is no Home button at the bottom of the front of the device, Google did put a large bezel under the screen, which takes up space that could have been used for more display surface. As explained above, the back of the phone is partially covered by Gorilla Glass 4 glass, which covers the digital fingerprint scanner (not to be confused with a Home button), the NFC chip, the rear-facing camera of 12 MP and double LED flash (surrounded by a very thin aluminum frame). The second part of the rear is made of aluminum with the engraved G for Google. The antenna, which is a strip at the bottom of the phone, can also be seen. The advantage of this mix of materials is that fingerprints aren\u2019t scattered over the entire device. The fingerprint scanner is integrated into the glass covering. \u00a9 AndroidPIT The power button, which is slightly textured, can be found on the right hand side of the device above the volume control buttons. On the left, there\u2019s a nano SIM slot. Don\u2019t look for a microSD card slot though because it doesn\u2019t exist. Also, Google decided not to make the Pixel completely resistant to water with a certification of only IP53, which is quite feeble next to the IP68 certification of the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge and the Galaxy Note 7. The phones that I have mentioned can be dunked into a meter of water for up to 30 minutes, a feat that you should not attempt with the Pixel. In the Pixel\u2019s case, you could use it in pouring rain, but only under the condition that it is held vertically. The power button is slightly textured. \u00a9 AndroidPIT All in all, the Pixel has been a tactile pleasure: your fingers land right on the buttons and the dimensions will please all those looking for a compact and unobtrusive smartphone. I also preferred the black model, though I would be happy with the silver one as well. However, when comparing the phone to its main rivals, the Pixel doesn\u2019t really stand out from the pack, as it doesn\u2019t have that long-awaited wow factor we had all hoped to see. Is it elegant? Yes. But exceptional? No.\n\nGoogle Pixel display The Google Pixel offers a 5-inch AMOLED screen with full HD resolution of 1080 x 1920, which is sufficient for a good viewing experience. Some may complain about the lack of a QHD display, which Google put on the Pixel XL, especially with the release of their Daydream platform and virtual reality goggles. For normal usage, full HD is more than adequate. Google optimized the user interface for Pixel, the icons are smaller and give the impression that the screen is in fact QHD. The Full HD AMOLED display is a sight for sore eyes. \u00a9 AndroidPIT It comes as no surprise that the viewing angle for the Google Pixel is very good. I did find that the brightness was a little weak at times, though the colors were vivid and the text was very clear. Contrast and saturation were also excellent. When using the phone outside in broad daylight, I had no problem seeing what was on the screen. On the whole, my findings definitely led me to the conclusion that the display is top notch. Finally, the display\u2019s only fault that I was able to determine was its frailty. I noticed a scratch after having put the smartphone alongside another one in my jeans pocket. This really surprised me seeing as the phone is protected by Gorilla Glass 4.\n\nGoogle Pixel special features Google Pixel support The Pixel offers its users support, which goes under the name of Care by Google. This service is available from 9 AM to 9 PM from Monday to Friday and from 10 AM to 6 PM on the weekends. It is available directly from the Pixel settings, found in the left tab (called Support) next to the tab with all other Settings features (All). Google offers its services via two different methods: firstly, you can chat with a Google support technician or secondly, you can call them directly on the phone. Also, you can share your screen with a Google expert if need be, providing you give them the rights to do so beforehand. However, this is optional if you wish to preserve your privacy. Google Support is available almost 24/7. \u00a9 AndroidPIT I was able to test out this service on the weekend and it worked perfectly. I think that this solution will help countless users fix their problems, especially those who aren\u2019t so technically inclined. Before accepting help, you need to give the support service permission to access your screen. \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nGoogle Pixel software This is where Google\u2019s latest update, Android 7.1 Nougat, is able to shine; both Pixel smartphones come with this operating system. This is the first time that this version has seen the light of day on a smartphone in 2016. It contains exclusive functions such as the integration of Google Assistant. Google has also assured that the phone would receive 2 years\u2019 worth of system updates and three years\u2019 worth of security updates. I would have hoped for more, especially since this is Google\u2019s new baby. Apple, on the other hand, puts Google to shame by offering 4 or 5 years\u2019 worth of updates for the same price. The purest and most fluid Android experience yet. The Pixel comes out of the box with Android 7.1 Nougat. \u00a9 AndroidPIT Google claims that Pixel puts forward the best Android experience that can be offered today. After one week of using the phone, I can confidently say that they weren\u2019t lying. The software running on Pixel offers much more than what other Android smartphones are able to offer. The pure , simple and lightning fast interface was breathtaking. The apps open and close at warp speed. I didn\u2019t notice any bugs or glitches, nor did any apps close unexpectedly. There is no bloatware to speak of, only two applications are pre-installed, Google Duo and Allo. UPDATE: Google is now rolling out an update in Canada (and likely soon in the US and worldwide) which will allow users to wake their screen to see their notifications and alerts using the same double tap and raise-to-wake functions as their Nexus predecessors. Pixel Launcher is the default on the Pixel. \u00a9 AndroidPIT The design is also easy on the eye with its small circular icons. Google also had the smart idea to integrate Force Touch, a feature that Apple also has. This means that when you long press on an app icon, you get access to multiple shortcuts (up to 5) to launch various actions. For example, by default Google will offer the option to display your route home. Google adds shortcuts to apps when long pressing on them. \u00a9 AndroidPIT A second partition, which is also a new feature, allows silent updates to roll out much more smoothly. Android updates are in fact installed in the background and happen automatically when you restart your phone, which saves you the long wait usually occurs with Android updates. Google Assistant Another exciting addition to the new interface is the perfect integration of Google Assistant. Thanks to this feature, the user experience with Pixel is very different to that of other smartphones. Searches are always carried out in context and, thanks to the system\u2019s Artificial Intelligence, are spoken out loud to you. Google Assistant can be activated by long pressing the on-screen Home button. Assistant is the pi\u00e8ce de resistance of the Pixel smartphones. Its interface is simple and the voice sounds very pleasant. That being said, I don\u2019t see why I need to start a conversation with Google Assistant when I can simply search for something through the Google app. I also found that Assistant is still missing some functions and it seems that it is still under development, so future versions should be much better. For example, I couldn\u2019t order a pizza. Though this comes down to personal taste, Google Assistant shouldn\u2019t be your sole reason for buying a Pixel.\n\nGoogle Pixel performance The Snapdragon 821 (alongside the Samsung Exynos 8890) is the fastest processor that exists for Android. It has been optimized to work smoothly with the VR Daydream platform, contrary to the Snapdragon 820. It is also great for gaming. The Pixel boasts the best possible equipment to offer great usability and performance without compromise. With 4 GB of RAM, it offers high speed performance for all multitasking purposes. The Google Pixel\u2019s excellent performance often outshone even the Galaxy S7 in some areas. This is probably the most optimized Android smartphone I have ever used. The only time the phone overheated (however this was only ever so slightly) was when I took some photos with the camera or played some graphically demanding games. The Google Pixel doesn't overheat more than its competitors. \u00a9 AndroidPIT Google has also upped the ante when it comes to gaming experience, providing a better experience than the Nexus can offer and even better than the Galaxy S7 in some instances. Its biggest weakness is, however, its small memory, which cannot be expanded with a microSD card. The system uses up 7 GB of the 32 GB model, leaving just 25 GB for apps, pictures etc. If you are an app addict, then you will soon run out of space. Thankfully, Google offers unlimited cloud storage for high resolution pictures, which should compensate for the lack of the microSD card slot. Here are the benchmark results that we received for the Pixel: 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.1 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited ES 2.0 Geekbench 4 - single core Geekbench 4 - multicore Google Octane 2.0 PC Mark Work Performance Google Pixel 3329 2558 27702 1574 3980 8791 5262 Galaxy\n\nS7 edge 2362 1976 30310 2018 6248 10292 4607\n\nGoogle Pixel audio Here lies one of the Pixel\u2019s biggest problems. Google clearly didn\u2019t make sound one of its priorities. The smartphone only has one mono speaker on the bottom of the device. This sound emitted is of average quality, which is sufficient for playing games or watching movies. That being said, the maximum volume becomes a little warped and is not pleasant to listen to. What\u2019s more, when holding the device, your fingers tend to cover up the speaker. On the other hand, using the Google Pixel for phone calls won\u2019t leave you disappointed. I had excellent reception, even in the subway and both the caller and callee could hear each other perfectly. Only the left side hides a speaker. \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nGoogle Pixel camera Google chose not to offer a double camera, a new trend followed by the likes of LG, Huawei and Apple. Its main camera shoots with 12.3 MP. According to the DXOMark, the Pixel is one of the best smartphones for taking pictures, beating rivals like the Galaxy S7. The Google Pixel has a great camera. \u00a9 AndroidPIT While testing the device, I also came to the conclusion that it has a good camera. But the best? Not really. When comparing it with the S7, I found that the Pixel was less apt at taking pictures of moving objects. The Pixel also doesn\u2019t have an optical image stabilizer however, this didn\u2019t cause a problem when shooting videos. This feature did make a difference with pictures though. Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6s camera. \u00a9 AndroidPIT The camera interface is no different than the one found on Nexus devices, coming with the same features, 4K video and fast motion. I had fun using slow motion after shooting videos. The front shooter offers 8 MP (1.55 \u00b5m) and an aperture of f/2.0. There\u2019s also a point laser and a dual tone flash. The Pixel will satisfy any selfie fan. The camera interface is classic, simple and efficient. \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nGoogle Pixel battery The Pixel comes with a 2770 mAh battery. Considering the phone\u2019s thickness, I would have expected more. For example, phones of the same quality offer batteries around the 3000 mAh mark, like the Galaxy S7, the Huawei P9 and the Xiaomi Mi 5. Here is what happened to the Pixel battery when using the phone at full throttle. \u00a9 AndroidPIT Thankfully, Google was able to perfectly optimize hardware and software to reduce unnecessary battery drainage, which became apparent while I was testing it. I wouldn't say that it has the best longevity out of all the phones on the market, but it will give you a good day\u2019s worth of usage even if you use it at full throttle (taking pictures, 4K videos, benchmark tests, WhatsApp, emails, games etc.). You can count on the Pixel for about 5 hours with normal brightness before the battery starts to dwindle. If you don\u2019t use it so intensely, your battery life will be longer. There is no wireless charging, however quick charging is available. Within an hour and a half, your phone will be ready to go again. During Google\u2019s unveiling of the device, they had promised a full 7 hours of usage after just 15 minutes of charging. This, however, is not very realistic.\n\nGoogle Pixel technical specifications\n\nType: Phone Model: Sorry, not yet available! Manufacturer: Google Dimensions: 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.6 mm Weight: 143 g Battery size: 2770 mAh Screen size: 5 in Display technology: AMOLED Screen: 1920 x 1080 pixels (441 ppi) Front camera: 8 megapixels Rear camera: 12.3 megapixels Flashlight: Dual-LED Android version: 7.1 - Nougat User interface: Stock Android RAM: 4 GB Internal storage: 32 GB\n\n128 GB Removable storage: Sorry, not yet available! Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Number of cores: 4 Max. clock speed: 2.15 GHz Connectivity: HSPA, LTE, NFC, Bluetooth 4.2\n\n\n\nFinal verdict My thoughts on the Pixel? For Google\u2019s first independent smartphone, they did a good job and it fits right in alongside other high contenders on the market. Apple has its iPhone, Google has its Pixel. If you\u2019re looking for the best Android experience, Pixel is the way to go. The system is smooth, performance is excellent and you are sure to get system updates on time and ahead of the pack. It has a remarkable camera and offers a support service that you can reach almost 24/7. Not only that, the fact that it can be easily rooted will also make modders and tweakers happy. The down side is, of course, the high price. One should consider if the Pixel is really worth it. Can the Pixel really compete with the star Android device of the moment, the Galaxy S7, which is about $200 less? The Pixel is a great smartphone but it is very expensive. Its design, though very elegant, is not very original and it is missing some functions which are sorely missed, such as a microSD slot. The Pixel smartphones by Google therefore still have a few things to fix before they can beat the bigger contenders on the mobile market - the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7. However, I am sure that the Google Pixel 2 will be better equipped and ready to take the Android world by storm.",

    "text": "Pok\u00e9mon Go was the pop culture phenomenon of the summer. Rarely has a mobile game gripped so many people around the world.\n\nInterest in capturing virtual critters has dwindled in recent months, but now Nintendo has a new app up its sleeve: Super Mario Run, which is hitting the mobile market this week.\n\nThe new game will take the classic formula of the Mario series \u2013 2D, side-scrolling platforming- and transplant it into an \u2018endless runner\u2019 game.\n\nThis has been a popular genre in mobile gaming for a while. The player\u2019s speed is automated by the computer, and they are charged with timing jumps and actions to avoid obstacles.\n\nThe further along the course you get, and the more coins you collect, the higher your score.\n\nNintendo\u2019s first smartphone game\n\nWhile Pok\u00e9mon Go was based on a franchise licensed by Nintendo, it wasn\u2019t actually developed by them.\n\nIn fact, the Japanese gaming giant \u2013 often seen as consistently innovative \u2013 has been accused of lagging behind when it comes to mobile gaming.\n\nFrom the Game Boy to the DS to the new Switch console, they have excelled at hand-held innovation \u2013 but have seemed reluctant to crack the lucrative mobile market.\n\nIf Super Mario Run can bring Nintendo\u2019s forward-thinking design to smartphones, it could be a literal game-changer.\n\nCost and connectivity\n\nRather than making money from potentially those sneaky in-app purchases, Nintendo is setting a base price for their game, with no such transactions after the fact.\n\nIt will cost \u00a37.99 at launch, with a free version that allows you to play the first three levels also available.\n\nThe game does need a persistent internet connection to run due to anti-piracy checks however \u2013 which has caused some criticism.\n\nWhether or not this leads to any serious issues while playing on the move remains to be seen.\n\nEase of use\n\nCreator Shigeru Miyamoto claims the magic of a Mario game is that anyone can pick it up and start playing.\n\nThat is also Nintendo\u2019s key aim with Super Mario Run.\n\nThe game has been designed with a balance between accessibility and challenge in mind, and can be played with only one hand. So it could be ideal for the commute.\n\nAnd with such a recognisable figure as its focal point, Nintendo will be confident it can match Pokemon Go\u2019s launch success.\n\nSuper Mario Run is released for iOS on 15 December, and an Android version is expected sometime in 2017",

    "title": "TRPA column: Tahoe Restoration Act\u2019s passage caps year of progress",
    "text": "Four years ago this month, TRPA approved the 2012 Regional Plan. The landmark plan charts a course to restore Lake Tahoe\u2019s environment and revitalize our communities and it was forged through Herculean work by California, Nevada, local governments, the public and dozens of other partners.\n\nMany Tahoe Basin stakeholders once questioned if we could work together, but the regional plan ushered in an era of collaboration. Today, the answer is how can we work together more efficiently. By building and strengthening partnerships we have made remarkable progress. This year was no different.\n\nEarlier this month, the icing on the 2016 cake of success came when Congress reauthorized the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. The bipartisan legislation authorizes up to $415 million in future federal funding appropriations for environmental restoration and conservation projects. Eight years of negotiation went into this legislation\u2019s passage, which was possible only because of the partnerships strengthened in 2012.\n\nWorking together, TRPA and Tahoe Fire and Fuels Team partners have also secured nearly $30 million in federal funding this year to remove hazardous fuels from Tahoe forests. These projects will improve forest health, reduce wildfire risk and build upon the 65,000 acres of forest already treated. Next summer marks the 10th year since the Angora Fire. Work to reduce hazardous fuels and create fire-adapted communities is ongoing and it must remain a top priority as we confront the realities of a changing climate.\n\nLocal governments and highway departments are implementing transportation projects that benefit the environment, enhance our economy and improve our quality of life. A new Class 1 bike path links South Lake Tahoe and Meyers and trails on the North and West shores continue to improve. Construction started this summer on a 3-mile trail from Incline Village to Sand Harbor. The showcase project will enhance recreation, improve safety, clean up stormwater pollution, and ease traffic and parking problems in one of Tahoe\u2019s most heavily-visited highway corridors.\n\nTRPA\u2019s forthcoming regional transportation plan will further outline the projects and strategies needed to reduce traffic congestion and improve bike trails and transit for residents and a growing number of visitors to more easily travel around our communities and to popular recreation sites without having to get in their cars at all.\n\nAs I sat at the 20th annual Presidential Summit this August, I was inspired to hear President Barack Obama give us his impression of Lake Tahoe. The president\u2019s comments brought joyous cheers from more than 7,500 people in attendance. It was Tahoe\u2019s first presidential visit in a decade and put a national spotlight on the lake and its environmental issues. While the president was joined on stage by Sens. Harry Reid, Dianne Feinstein, and Barbara Boxer, as well as California Gov. Jerry Brown, it was the sheer energy of the crowd and the beauty of Lake Tahoe that shined brightly that day.\n\nThe Environmental Improvement Program was launched at the first Presidential Summit in 1997 and today it is one of the nation\u2019s most successful environmental programs. Much of its success has been fueled by the original Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000. Through the program, local, state, federal, nonprofit and private sector partners have completed hundreds of projects to remove hazardous fuels from forests; restore streams, wetlands and marshes; protect the lake from invasive species; upgrade hundreds of miles of roads to reduce stormwater pollution; and build bike and pedestrian trails.\n\nPartners around the basin are working together like never before to implement the regional plan and projects that benefit the environment and our communities. TRPA is committed to doing its part, and is working on strategic initiatives to accelerate environmental redevelopment, upgrade transportation infrastructure and transit services, improve the health and resilience of Tahoe\u2019s forests, and examine and improve how we measure the region\u2019s success.\n\nThe vote to reauthorize the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act is the strongest sign yet that we are on the right track. It signals that our federal partners are committed to Lake Tahoe and that after two decades the lake\u2019s health remains a national priority. Collaboration is the cornerstone to our successes and it is the binding rule that we will see our progress grow in years to come.\n\nCasey Beyer is the California governor appointee to the TRPA Governing Board and the 2015-16 board chair.",

Sometimes.\n\nQ I had the recent displeasure of driving Interstate 280 in a rainstorm after 11 p.m. I had not driven this freeway from San Francisco to San Jose during a rainstorm at night in years. I was extremely disappointed to find that a large number of the reflective lane markers are missing, making it difficult to determine where the lanes are. When you couple this with the continued high-speed vehicles, 70 to 80 mph, the road becomes extremely dangerous.

    "text": "Across the land: Burial plots become prime real estate\n\nA growing world population means burial spaces are becoming hot real estate. Photo: Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York by Plowboylifestyle\n\nPHUKET: The current world population is 7.3 billion, but it is expected to hit 8.5 billion by the year 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050, according to a new United Nations DESA report, titled \u0091World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision\u2019.\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific is also now home to half of the world\u2019s population of elderly persons, defined as people aged 60 years or older.\n\n\n\nWith an aging society weighing down its future, Asia is looking at more elderly people dying with less and less space available to bury the dead. Combining cultural, traditional beliefs for dealing with the departed, city planners and private companies are seeking modern ways to bury the departed with efficiency and respect.\n\n\n\nIntegrated death service providers are all the rage now, offering a wide range of services from funeral consultation and planning to transportation, embalming, cosmetology, cremation, funeral services, burial plots, ash burial plots, tomb design, landscaping, site maintenance, and so on.\n\n\n\nIn Japan, locker style columbarium are known as \u0091nikotsudo\u2019. The Ruriden Byakurengedo columbarium has modern wall-to-wall Buddha statues representing 2,000 digitized burial plots and guests can visit their deceased loved ones using an electronic ID card.\n\n\n\nThe Arlington National Cemetery in the US has begun implementing a digital, geo-spatial technology to improve operations and provide a better experience for families and friends of the departed, whether visiting the departed in person or online, making it one of the most high-tech cemeteries in the world.\n\n\n\nHong Kong investors are looking to turning a cruise ship into the world\u2019s first seaborne columbarium. Hong Kong, known for its scarcity of space even for the living, has been seeking innovative ideas to deal with the critical storage of \u0091urn\u2019 spaces. It is expected that 48,000 urn spaces will be created to store the cremated remains of the deceased.\n\n\n\nUsually when we plan to invest in real estate products or investments for our future, retirement or children, we think of purchasing a brick and mortar, physical structure or building we could live in, rent out or sell for capital gains. We hardly think of \u0091investing\u2019 in a burial plot or urn space for when we die.\n\n\n\nUnbelievably, waiting lists for burial plots and urn spaces in Japan and Hong Kong are longer than waiting lists for purchasing a brand new condominium. Some private investors purchase burial plots or urn spaces and seek to sell them later at a profit. Similar to real estate, investment in burial plots or urn spaces follows the same principles: location is key.\n\n\n\nInnovative death service providers have created \u0091burial plots or urn space packages\u2019 for individuals, couples and families, who even after death wish to remain together as a couple or family. Such packages can be paid in full, with monthly payments or even in installments during the lifetime prior to death. This usually provides assurance to the deceased that their families and loved ones do not experience any financial strain during this sad time.\n\n\n\nAmy Koh is the sales manager of Engel & Voelkers Phuket.

    "title": "The Question Is: Can The UN Survive The Trump Era?",
    "text": "The United Nations will swear in Ant\u00f3nio Guterres as its ninth secretary-general on Dec. 12, when the organization will be only weeks away from the inauguration of Donald Trump and the potentially most threatening, hostile political opposition to the UN ever assembled in Washington, D.C. The UN will have to be prepared to respond and defend its record. Most likely, it will also have to fend off a wave of \"fake news\" and bogus sites designed to weaken public support in the United States and around the world. It will have to expand its audience reach as well.\n\nBy many accounts, the UN has fallen off the map.\n\nMany factors are responsible for this situation. Inside the organization, competent staff members are silenced by an atmosphere that has made speaking out too big a risk to careers, even within the Secretariat or in high-profile missions around the world. Opaque, overburdened and ineffective UN information systems are largely not up to contemporary competition. Major international media have cut back coverage of the UN. Reporters who remain, denied access to officials and critical internal reports, are thrust into an adversarial role. Outside the UN, teaching and research about the organization have atrophied or have all but disappeared from most universities. Social media moves quickly into the vacuum, often with harmful disinformation.\n\nAlarms are being raised around the world about what a Trump administration will mean for international programs and institutions. Among the many commentaries on various subjects, the British medical journal The Lancet took the unusual step of publishing a full-page editorial warning that American \"commitment to global health and development could be at risk.\"\n\nInside the UN, scores of officials and their staff at all levels are primarily preoccupied with the arrival of Guterres and his new team and worry about their futures in the organization. To make matters worse for UN officials, they see no coherent foreign policy being articulated by Trump, whose impulsive pronouncements and tweets -- he has not held a news conference since July -- flip-flop from day to day on issues important to the organization. He does not attend most national intelligence briefings, which are customarily given to presidents-elect.\n\n\"I don't think people are thinking about the Trump administration,\" a UN official said, \"because, frankly, we really don't know what to think. First of all, we don't know who to talk to; there's no foreign policy transition team. The transition from Ban [Ki-moon] to Guterres is what we are focusing on now.\" That transition, he said, is going smoothly. By an accident of history, the UN and US are getting new leadership at the same time, putting a priority in both New York and Washington on internal decisions.\n\nSeveral high-ranking UN officials, including Secretary-General Ban, have publicly condemned the harsh policies Trump endorsed during the presidential campaign and as president-elect, such as torture, religious profiling, mass deportations and bans on immigration. Trump's harshest and most outspoken UN critic in recent months has been the high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein, who has called Trump a danger to the world. Trump's attempts in recent weeks to tone done hardline threats, possibly only a tactic against public outrage, are met with some skepticism.\n\nThe appointment of Nikki Haley as US ambassador to the UN attests to Trump's apparent lack of interest in ensuring a strong presence at the organization. Haley, the governor of South Carolina and an early critic of Trump, has no experience in multilateral institutions or foreign policy and seems more likely to have been chosen to meet pressures on the Trump administration to find women and appointees from minority groups for cabinet positions; her parents migrated from India. Haley's departure for New York -- she must first be confirmed by the Senate -- also conveniently leaves in her place in South Carolina a lieutenant governor whose views are more in line with Trump's.\n\nRichard Gowan of the European Council on Foreign Relations and the Center for International Cooperation at New York University, described the president-elect in World Politics Review on Nov. 16 as demonstrating \"an utterly incoherent vision of international security.\"\n\nAt the same time, while the nationalists in the team that Trump is putting in place in his White House may know the world better, they are not shy about broadcasting their biases. Michael Flynn, the nominee for White House national security adviser, recently retweeted a message alleging that the new UN development goals would lead to a global ban on Christianity, according to a CNN review of his Twitter use. Unesco and the US Fund for Unicef, among others, have also been targets of online misinformation from obscure sources, which they have publicly refuted.\n\n\n\nIn the US Congress, the solid control that Republicans now have over both houses jeopardizes the commitments to pay UN assessments and contributions to the UN, which the Obama administration honored for the core UN Secretariat, as well as its peacekeeping role and humanitarian work. UN agencies and many other international programs in the larger UN system could also see their US contributions slashed, with the UN Population Fund an obvious first target because of its support -- shared by the UN as a whole -- for safe, legal abortion.\n\nThere have already been calls on Capitol Hill to withdraw the US from the Human Rights Council, which falls under the purview of Hussein, and even the UN itself, though critics might pause at the thought of losing a permanent Security Council seat.\n\nThere is a lot to lose. By any measure, the US -- and the American people -- are the largest contributors to the UN system and its many activities around the world. In 2016, the US was assessed 22 percent of the organization's regular budget, while China was billed roughly 8 percent and Russia, 3 percent. Assessments for the peacekeeping budget for 2016-2018 were calculated at 28 percent for the US, 6 percent for China and 3 percent for Russia. These assessments -- dues derived from treaty obligations -- are only part of the hundreds of millions of dollars that go to special appeals, UN agencies outside the Secretariat and other forms of contributions.\n\nThe cost of UN membership is emphasized and often exaggerated in writing that is critical of the organization. Several influential Washington think tanks with conservative, often anti-UN agendas and publications inform Republican opinion in the White House and Congress. Among them are the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute and the libertarian-right Cato Institute. Gone from the US Senate are moderate outward-looking Republican supporters of the UN, like the late Charles Percy of Illinois and, more recently, Richard Lugar of Indiana, a Senate leader on foreign affairs, who lost a primary re-election bid in 2012 to a Tea Party challenger. Lugar later founded the Lugar Center, which focuses on global food security. In 2016, he was awarded the Fulbright Prize for International Understanding.\n\nAmong the general public, Republicans in the US routinely hold a more negative opinion of the UN than Democrats or Independents. A Pew Research Center poll in 2013 showed Democrats giving the UN a 72 percent favorable rating, with Independents at 60 percent. Republicans were not only on the low end of the scale, at 41 percent, but had also been steadily dropping over preceding years. A 2016 Gallup poll found that only 38 percent of Americans thought the UN was doing a good job; 54 percent said it was not and 8 percent didn't know. The rest of the world leaves the US well behind in knowledge of how the UN works\n\n.\n\nThe Trump team has a fertile field in which to plant more doubts about the UN and galvanize action against it.\n\nPeacekeeping stories you will never read\n\nIn 1999, Kofi Annan, UN secretary-general at the time, and his spokesman, Fred Eckhard, published media guidelines for UN officials that for the first time in the organization's history introduced a formal policy of being \"open and transparent in its dealings with the press.\" The guidelines, initially devised for the peacekeeping department, gave all Secretariat staff members the right to speak to the media on subjects \"within your area of competence and responsibility,\" but to \"provide facts, but not opinions or comment.\" The guidelines are still in effect, according to the UN spokesman's office, though they have languished and are disregarded repeatedly.\n\nIn no area has this unwillingness to listen to UN staff or allow them to do honest reporting been more harmful to the organization than in peacekeeping. Internal information on scandals of various sorts have been suppressed, ignored or shelved for unconscionable periods of time by higher-ranking people in a hierarchical system. Outsiders -- in the media, nongovernmental organizations and sometimes courageous staff within the UN -- make these scandals public, putting the organization immediately in a defensive position, as allegations fire up critics. Furthermore, UN peacekeeping operations are dynamic environments in which reporters can see the UN in action for themselves, often in dramatic post-conflict settings around the globe.\n\nEvery peacekeeping mission has a large public information unit dedicated to ensuring that the local population understands the mandate of the peacekeepers and to garnering international support for their operations. But lately, with shrinking newsroom budgets and the closing of international bureaus, news organizations don't send as many reporters to cover far-flung conflicts that are only simmering, or cooling, when more dramatic stories compete. Western troops are sporadically involved as UN peacekeepers, with some exceptions, as in Mali, and the lives and contributions of \"blue helmets\" from developing countries carry far less significance in the international media.\n\nIn peacekeeping missions, communications officers are expected to sell trite \"positive\" stories to the media, while withholding comment on more complex or sensitive issues, from political negotiations to outbreaks of violence. Recent headlines -- from attacks on civilians in South Sudan to sex abuse by peacekeepers in Central Africa and the cholera epidemic in Haiti -- dominate in media, which give minimal coverage to other aspects of a mission, each one a complex operation taking more than tweets to explain fully.\n\nRoberto Capocelli, a Fulbright scholar from Italy, worked as a human-rights public information officer with Monusco -- the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- the largest peacekeeping operation. The mission had been mired in bad news when a landmark human-rights trial took place in 2014, conducted by Congolese courts with assistance from Monusco and UN human-rights officials. A notorious war criminal, Bedi Mobuli Engangela, or \"Colonel 106,\" who had long terrorized communities in eastern Congo, was finally meeting justice.\n\nCapocelli got to the trial ahead of the international media and with his deep knowledge of the issues, wrote up the story, stressing the UN's contributions in logistics and protecting witnesses. He sent it for release to his superiors at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. It was published two months later, virtually unchanged but buried in an obscure part of the UN Human Rights website. A video he made on the event was never used.\n\n\"In the end, we are not journalists,\" Capocelli said recently. \"But everyone had been complaining about impunity and after a huge investment of time and resources, [the UN] managed to do something good, especially at the moment the UN was under criticism for child abuse, corruption and inaction. Everyone is aware of this dynamic, how much the bureaucratic process can stop you from acting. I had the impression my work was not really needed.\"\n\nSusan Manuel, a writer for PassBlue and an American journalist before joining the UN, worked in some of the most important and dangerous peacekeeping missions in the world, in addition to spending eight years in UN headquarters. During that time, she saw the relationship between UN missions and the media shrink from her first decade in Cambodia, South Africa, the Balkans and Afghanistan to her final posting in Darfur before retiring in 2012.\n\n\"In Cambodia, the UN peacekeeping mission, Untac [the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia] was narrating the electoral process to a large international press corps,\" she said in a written interview. \"In the former Yugoslavia, I literally saw coverage of the UN improve after making an effort to get to know the local and regional journalists and provide them with concrete information. We told the story, even when the UN failed, even when the so-called UN-protected enclaves in Croatia and Bosnia were overrun. We public information officers were reporting these events in real time to media because these people were our responsibility.\"\n\n\"In Kosovo we were narrating the growth of a new administration -- with regular press briefings, interviews, guided visits for journalists,\" she said. \"We fed them constantly, and not with fluff, as these were discerning professionals, some of them veteran war correspondents.\n\n\"There were incidents of exploitation and abuse of the local population by peacekeepers in those earlier missions -particularly Cambodia and Somalia,\" Manuel said. \"But they didn't threaten to bring down UN peacekeeping. Journalists knew these were complex and largely vital enterprises, which they covered on a daily basis. Scandals weren't the only headlines.\n\n\"In Afghanistan, the UN mission was the most credible voice during a long saga of conflict, peace processes and human rights struggles, and the media depended a great deal on it.\n\n\"But when I arrived in Darfur [in 2011], the international media were gone, local media were ignored and the conflict was invisible, even -- to a large extent -- to the peacekeepers. We weren't saying much about it.\n\n\"Senior UN mission officials disdained the sole opposition radio station, Dabanga,\" she recalled. \"Sometimes it was only when a blogger, Matthew [Russell] Lee, who is based in New York, read out reports from Dabanga on incidents in Darfur at the daily briefing by the secretary-general's spokesman in New York that we could convince the mission leaders to respond. Or, I would figure out ways to release information surreptitiously by embedding it in otherwise anodyne messages or op-eds from the head of mission.\"\n\nWhen she retired from the UN, Manuel wrote in her end-of-assignment report on Darfur -- where hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed as Sudan's repressive government battled a regional rebellion from 2003 to 2009 -- that UN policy makers needed to decide whether the peacekeeping information offices are there to promote only the \"good news\" of the mission or to \"get and disseminate clear factual information about the situation on the ground related to our mandate,\" which, Manuel added, \"could enhance our credibility and lead to realistic responses.\"\n\n\"Is it our role to report publicly on the conflict, as part of the mission's security and protection of civilians' mandate, or is it 'none of your business,' as one senior official told me after repeated requests to be included in information on fighting and human rights abuses?\"\n\nShortly after Manuel left Darfur, Aicha El Basri arrived as spokeswoman for Unamid [the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur], lasting only eight months in what she called an \"Orwellian\" situation. In 2014, she dropped a Snowden-like bombshell, when she leaked thousands of code cables and emails to Foreign Policy magazine, which led to a series of articles excoriating the UN-African Union mission in Darfur. The Security Council and even the International Criminal Court demanded answers as El Basri, a Moroccan-American, had claimed the mission was covering up crimes against humanity.\n\nSecretary-General Ban ordered an internal review, which confirmed five instances of underreporting or no reporting, of attacks against civilians and peacekeepers. He told the Security Council that \"the media policy of UNAMID will be re-examined to ensure greater openness and transparency.\" He exhorted other missions as well: \"Ensuring that the UN speaks out consistently against abuses and identifies the perpetrators is a key goal of my Human Rights Up Front Initiative.\"\n\nHow this advice has translated into action at the UN is hard to determine.\n\nBut recent crises involving peacekeepers indicate that the operations tend to react publicly only after the media has exposed them. By then, the mission has lost the opportunity to put its perspective out front authoritatively. The UN mission in Mali, on the other hand, has received more nuanced media attention, as the UN's most dangerous mission. It gives regular press briefings and maintains an\n\ninformative website, in French and English, Manuel noted.\n\n\"As only a consumer of media these days, it can be painful to read some of the headlines,\" Manuel said, \"because I know there are good people out there trying their hardest. But a UN perspective explaining the background is often missing. And if you go to the Facebook pages of some of the missions dealing with crises, it's just la la land. The fact the sites have so few comments or shares tells me not many people are buying that version of reality.\"\n\nAn information center in need of more resources\n\nThe hub for most news and documentation in the UN Secretariat is the Department of Public Information, known universally in the system as DPI, which was established in 1946 \"to promote global awareness and understanding of the work of the United Nations.\" An office of the spokesperson for the secretary-general was added later as part of DPI, but has since migrated (without cutting all links there) to the orbit of the the secretary-general's staff, with independent functions as a conduit to media reporting on the organization. Agencies and programs outside the Secretariat, as well as major departments within headquarters, have their own communications specialists, but their work can be affected by practices and attitudes at UN headquarters.\n\nOutside the UN, diplomatic missions of countries include public-affairs officers who reflect and explain the policies of their respective governments.\n\nAt DPI's founding, there were 51 mostly like-minded member countries in the UN. Now 193 countries are represented at the UN, offering many points of view on what news and information the UN should or should not be disseminating, particularly most recently on social developments like the recognition of LGBT rights or the promotion of women's personal reproductive rights, to which numerous nations do not subscribe, at least in practice. LGBT issues are notably not in the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\"We are a melting pot of cultures poured into a bureaucracy designed in the 1950s,\" St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the secretary-general's spokesman, said in an interview.\n\nThe Department of Public Information is also completely hamstrung by its mandate, officials acknowledge, and the head of the office, who ranks as under secretary-general, is not chosen primarily for his or her media skills, but is often a political appointee with little or no journalism experience. He or she must work under tight budgetary conditions deliberately framed to not give the department the tools it needs. Samir Sanbar, who headed the office from 1993 to 1997, said in an interview that he was flatly denied funds by the General Assembly budget committee to create a UN website. Instead, he stretched the resources of his existing staff to develop the platform.\n\n\"Even the idea of information going to the public remains always a question of arguments with member states,\" he said. \"Senior officials within the Secretariat were [also] not so keen on it. Peacekeeping, and even the office of the secretary-general, were afraid we were giving too much information to the public. I said: 'This is what our job is! We need to reach the public. We need the public to support us.' \"\n\nSusan Markham, a former director of strategic communications at the UN from New Zealand and a frequent spokeswoman for many UN summits and global conferences, analyzed in a memo for PassBlue some of the constraints faced by the department:\n\no DPI is not able to reach out to the public of a member state to try to try to counter criticism of the organization by that member state's government. Such activity could be interpreted as being contrary to the UN Charter (intervening in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of a member state). DPI has been encouraged by member states to limit its activities to 'informing' the world about what it does, not doing crisis communications. The UN does not have its own voice or opinion, unless it is shared by a majority of member states.\n\n\n\no Budget cuts and constant restructuring forced on the DPI disrupts its effectiveness. DPI has gone through more 'restructurings' than any other UN department. First to go were information staff in the field, at a time when most organizations were touting the effectiveness of decentralization and opening field offices. DPI is supposed to tell the UN's story to the world like a media or public relations company with a fraction of the resources. And, unlike most media or PR companies, DPI produces most of its material in more than six languages. Materials generally use 'UN-speak' rather than language that is clear and succinct. Journalists covering the UN find this particularly frustrating.\n\n\n\no DPI is micromanaged by member states through the General Assembly's committee on information, which oversees everything DPI does. Endless reports have to be prepared for its annual meeting, and DPI staff spend days making presentations, monitoring the debate and (sometimes) lobbying on behalf of a favorite activity that might get the chop. Few if any of the delegates in the committee have any communications expertise. DPI is part of a bureaucratic and diplomatic organization.\n\n\n\no DPI staff are also not always journalists or communications experts, and the department is often seen as the dumping ground for UN employees that other departments want to get rid of. The head of DPI is often a political appointee. UN personnel policies make it hard for DPI staff to stay in jobs they are trained for -- in radio, for example -- and have to move up to management or be transferred to some other job.\n\n\n\no Much of the UN's work relates to processes. Progress on solving complex issues like poverty, for example, is incremental and therefore not newsworthy. There are only so many public relations 'tools' that can be used -- like creating International Days, or holding conferences and seminars, which are worthy but commonplace and often boring.\n\n\n\no DPI suffers from self-censorship. Although there is a great deal of freedom to develop the content of its materials, something perceived as critical by a member government or another UN department brings complaints that the UN takes seriously. Experienced DPI staff know the boundaries.\n\n\n\no When a scandal breaks out, the UN is not equipped to respond. In a bureaucracy, no individual is responsible. It takes time for an internal investigation to find out what really happened. Meanwhile, the media are continuing to publicize the wrongdoing. When the transgression is committed not by a UN employee but by peacekeepers or others who are not considered UN staff, there is even less sense of ownership and responsibility. Of course, this distinction is lost on the public, which considers all of them \"the UN.\"\n\n\n\nDuring the tenure of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, his senior adviser and under secretary-general for communications and public information, Shashi Tharoor, an Indian, closed numerous UN information centers abroad, most in Western Europe. UN officials, past and present, think this was a serious mistake, because they had been useful service hubs for journalists and focal points for national governments. The UN continues to maintain centers in many developing countries, as well as one in Washington, which monitors Congress and government policies generally. The UN took a hit from the consolidation in 2003-2004 of two-thirds of the Western European centers. Only three remain: a regional center in Brussels and two in Geneva and Vienna, where the UN has sizable offices.\n\n\n\nHelmut Volger, a contributor to PassBlue from Berlin and author of A Concise Encyclopedia of the United Nations, published in German and English, is also a co-founder of the German UN Research Network (www.forschungskreis-vereinte-nationen.de).\n\n\"In general, the position of the United Nations in Europe with regard to the media has been severely weakened by the closure of nine excellent West European UN information centers by UN-DPI, being replaced by an ineffective and bureaucratic regional UN information center in Brussels,\" he wrote in a memo for this article. \"In Germany, for instance, that meant a clear-cut reduction of media attention from then on.\"\n\nVolger argues that there is little reporting now on the UN across Europe, except on the activities of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. \"A typical example of the ignorance of the media is the UN office in Bonn,\" he said. \"Even though Bonn is the seat of the secretariat of the important UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, that does not motivate the German media to cover the work there sufficiently.\" He added that there has generally been a widespread decrease in interest in the European media about UN topics, above all from television.\n\n\"In this situation, the national UN associations such as UNA-UK in Great Britain and the United Nations Association of Germany, try skillfully to draw the attention of the media to the UN topics through events such as panel discussions with high-level UN officials or 'guided tours' for journalists to UN peacekeeping missions,\" Volger wrote. \"But these efforts cannot replace full-time professional media relations work.\"\n\nNavigating the expanding ocean of digital media\n\nSamir Sanbar, who pioneered the UN's presence on the Internet two decades ago, says that when he wants to look up a UN document or other information on the UN now, he turns to Google. It is a common complaint: navigating the UN's website is hard work and time-consuming.\n\n\"I agree that the search function on many of the UN.org sites is frustrating,\" wrote Laura Kirkpatrick, who handles social media and writes for PassBlue. \"I've tried to find data on both UN Women and the UN on the site, and had better results Googling the information, which led directly to the UN hosted pages I was looking for, rather than going through the site itself.\n\n\"It may be that the amount of information that comes through is too much for each department to handle, but it does seem that there are disconnects,\" Kirkpatrick wrote. As an example, she cited the frequent updates issued by the secretary-general's spokesman's office via email. While the emails contain content that reads \"For specific statements, search in http://www.un.org/sg/statements/sgstatsarchive.asp,\" the link can take a user to a 404 error, a page where there may be a connection to the server the information is stored on, but the actual content isn't there.\n\nThe press-center pages and certain program sites are not much better, as obsolete content and inconsistent mapping -- how data is retrievable for search functions, for example -- create diversions rather than direct routes. For instance, content from Unifem, the now-defunct predecessor to UN Women, is still returned in searches on the UN Women site.\n\n\"I think the problem is that the staff behind the basic sites like UN Women -- but also the main sites for the Secretariat and General Assembly -- are not trained to think digitally or strategically,\" wrote Kirkpatrick, \"but rather in general communications mode. Just consider the URL UnitedNations.org. When you type it into the Google search bar, you get a football team in San Francisco, with no path to the un.org website. No one has thought, 'If I were a user, how would I search for this information?' It seems like each section of the site has its own bureaucracy for filing away information and charting through the content, but there is not one cohesive thought behind the complete package.\"\n\nBy contrast, the UN has developed extensive outreach through social media and emerging technologies, like digital broadcasts of live events that appear to have been given precedence over a traditional digital presence. The UN has several Facebook pages, and most entities, such as peacekeeping missions, have a Facebook presence, similarly with Instagram and Twitter, all delivering content and timely news.\n\nThe engagement of audiences via social media is erratic, sometimes depending on who is running the platform. From 2010, a Department of Public Information staff member, Nancy Groves, has directed all UN social media, including its Twitter account, which has nearly eight million followers; Facebook, two million; and Instagram, one million.\n\nIn an interview in May 2015 with Audiense, a site that monitors social media, Groves described how UN officials who initially disdained Twitter -- \"We don't need to be on social media\" -- have realized its importance in delivering not only news and information but also visual images, including photographs and graphics. Her small team has kept bureaucratic vetting to a minimum while satisfying various special interests in the system and among member countries.\n\nOn the other hand, the department's YouTube channel functions as little more than a parking lot for UN video products -many of them well-produced and informative programs designed for international broadcasters. Few people are using this critical platform for young audiences, with views for most clips in the 100s.\n\nMore alarming, a brief YouTube search of the term \"United Nations\" indicates that conspiracy theorists are on the verge of dominating this platform: of the first six results that appear, the most popular (with 220,050 views) is \"How Dangerous Is the United Nations?\" Of those six videos, four involve an imminent \"invasion\" by the UN.\n\nThe social media environment seems fertile ground for anyone with paranoia and an Internet connection, and in the new world order underway, the UN will need to find tools to fight back. Groves recently confronted at least two attempts by outsiders to create fake Twitter accounts for the incoming secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who is regarded as having a good record in communications in his decade as UN high commissioner for refugees.\n\nThe refugees agency has used the social media account of its spokeswoman, Melissa Fleming, to advocate on behalf of the 65-million-plus people who are displaced globally. On Facebook and Twitter, Fleming posts several articles and images daily to keep the plight of refugees and migrants visible to a global audience. A hashtag created by the agency in June, #WithRefugees, and a UN Women-led campaign with the hashtag #He4She, to inspire men to support equality, have developed celebrity followings and \"long tails,\" or a more focused audience.\n\n\"The UN Development Program, Unicef and the World Food Program, among others, have sites and content that are parsed for digital delivery and easily retrievable data. Compare that to the General Assembly site or the secretary-general's pages and it's as if they are two different organizations,\" wrote Kirkpatrick, about the many ways that content is delivered by the UN.\n\nWith an unfriendly US administration and a hostile Congress looming in Washington, the UN will require closer attention by the media, governments, nongovernment organizations and the foundations that support academic programs and other projects focused on the UN, since these spotlights have virtually disappeared.",
