    "title": "Sam Allardyce resigns: English football 'the laughing stock of the world', says Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand",
    "text": "Former England captain Alan Shearer has labelled English football the \u201claughing stock of the world\u201d after manager Sam Allardyce resigned on Tuesday night.\n\nJust 67 days into his reign, Allardyce left after an undercover sting captured him negotiating lucrative speaking engagements in the Far East and advising supposed Far East investors in how to get around Football Association rules on third-party ownership.\n\nAllardyce left his role by mutual consent after holding talks with the FA following The Telegraph\u2019s undercover operation that captured him, his agent Mark Curtis and football agent Scott McGarvey meeting undercover reporters who were posing as Far East businessmen looking to invest in English football.\n\nReacting to the news that Allardyce had left his role, Shearer told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I didn't think England could stoop any lower from what happened in the summer in the Euros (losing) to Iceland. And now, here we are. We're a laughing stock of world football.\n\n\"We've got a problem. It's greed, isn't it? We have to be able to accept people laughing at us.\"\n\nFellow former England captain Rio Ferdinand echoed Shearer\u2019s comments, and admitted the entire ordeal had been \u201ccomical\u201d due to the damage it has done to English football\u2019s reputation.\n\nEngland manager contenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 show all England manager contenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/6 Gareth Southgate - 6/4 Highly thought of by the decision-makers at the Football Association, the former Middlesbrough boss was brought into the fold to coach the Under-21s with an eye on future progression. Faltered at last year's Under-21 European Championship but led the team to victory at the Toulon tournament in the summer. Had no interest in succeeding Hodgson but takes charge for England's next four matches against Malta, Slovenia, Scotland and Spain while the FA looks for a permanent appointment. Getty\n\n2/6 Steve Bruce - 2/1 The former Manchester United defender was interviewed in the summer about the vacant England manager's job. Just days after speaking to the FA, Bruce decided to call time on his spell at Hull, where he had become the most successful manager in the club's history. He remains out of work. Getty\n\n3/6 Eddie Howe - 8/1 A smart, erudite and tactically-savvy coach who, at 38, looks to have a bright future at the top of the game. The manager has flourished at Bournemouth and only last week described coaching England as the \"ultimate\" job. \"I would never say no,\" Howe said. Getty\n\n4/6 Alan Pardew - 8/1 Seemed to be a new man after swapping Newcastle for Crystal Palace and some fine early-season results saw him seriously linked with the England job for the first time in his career. Reached the FA Cup final but league results tailed off badly. A slow start to this campaign has been followed by three successive Premier League victories. Getty\n\n5/6 Jurgen Klinsmann - 10/1 The former Tottenham striker has managerial experience at international level, having been in charge of the United States for almost five years and Germany before that. America fell to a semi-final Copa America exit in the summer while Klinsmann guided Germany to the last-four stage at the 2006 World Cup. Getty\n\n6/6 Gary Neville - 25/1 Seemed a heavy favourite to progress from his role as Hodgson's assistant until his ill-advised stint with Valencia saw his stock plummet. It may yet be decided that was a case of the wrong job but the right man. Out of coaching since exiting with Hodgson during the summer, the videos of Allardyce appear to show him saying Neville was the \"wrong influence\" on his predecessor. Getty\n\n\"I think the rest of the football community around the world will just be laughing at us,\u201d Ferdinand said on BT Sport. \u201cIt just feels like it's become a comical event, the England manager's role.\n\n\"This is the man who was probably the most vocal about getting the England job, the most passionate outwardly about getting the England job, but unfortunately he's backed the FA into a corner and they've had to act because of his actions.\"\n\nAlan Shearer believes the investigation has left England looking like a 'laughing stock' (Getty)\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke and chief executive Martin Glenn met with Allardyce at Wembley on Tuesday and left the 61-year-old in no doubt he had reached the end of a short road with the national side.\n\nAllardyce ultimately agreed to terminate his contract, having been left in an untenable position by a The Telegraph sting operation that captured him negotiating lucrative speaking engagements in the Far East as well as making indiscreet and damaging remarks about a range of issues including third-party ownership.\n\nGlenn, who led the three-man panel that nominated Allardyce in the summer, told FATV: \"It has been a really painful decision because obviously we've only just hired Sam.\n\nMartin Glenn: \"It's a painful decision but the right decision if we're to protect the integrity of The FA.\" pic.twitter.com/lJGQYoarTF \u2014 The FA (@FA) September 28, 2016\n\n\"We've concluded - and Sam's agreed - that his behaviour has been inappropriate and, frankly, not what is expected of an England manager.\n\n\"Sam, we think, is a great fit for England manager and we think could have been extremely successful.\n\nRio Ferdinand claimed the whole ordeal had been 'comical' (Getty)\n\n\"But the FA's more than just running the England men's team. We have to stand up for the right behaviours across the whole game. We're the guardians of the game, we set the rules.\n\n\"We have to be seen to apply those rules consistently and evenly, whether you're the England manager or someone low down in the organisation.\"\n\nAllardyce and Glenn at Euro 2020's launch event last week (Getty)\n\nClarke, who had yet to succeed Greg Dyke when Allardyce was installed, shared similar sentiments.\n\n\"We asked Sam how he felt, he said he was foolish and had said some unwise words and he recognised he had compromised his position,\" he added.\n\n\"When we discussed whether it was recoverable or not we all agreed it wasn't. We jointly agreed he moved on. I think he did a cracking job as England manager. He really lifted the team and he was doing great work with rebuilding morale and strategy but the reality was that after the revelations...his position was untenable.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by PA",

    "title": "History of slavery in US justifies reparations for African Americans, says UN",
    "text": "The history of slavery in the United States justifies reparations for African Americans, argues a recent report by a UN-affiliated group based in Geneva.\n\nThis conclusion was part of a study by the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, a body that reports to the international organization's High Commissioner on Human Rights. The group of experts, which includes leading human rights lawyers from around the world, presented its findings to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Monday, pointing to the continuing link between present injustices and the dark chapters of American history.\n\n\u201cIn particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent,\u201d the report stated. \u201cContemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching.\u201d\n\nCiting the past year's spate of police officers killing unarmed African American men, the panel warned against \u201cimpunity for state violence,\u201d which has created, in its words, a \u201chuman rights crisis\u201d that \u201cmust be addressed as a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\nThe panel drew its recommendations, which are nonbinding and unlikely to influence Washington, after a fact-finding mission in the United States in January. At the time, it hailed the strides taken to make the American criminal justice system more equitable but pointed to the corrosive legacy of the past.\n\n\u201cDespite substantial changes since the end of the enforcement of Jim Crow and the fight for civil rights, ideology ensuring the domination of one group over another, continues to negatively impact the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion amongst the US population.\u201d\n\nIn its report, it specifically dwells on the extrajudicial murders that were a product of an era of white supremacy:\n\nLynching was a form of racial terrorism that has contributed to a legacy of racial inequality that the United States must address. Thousands of people of African descent were killed in violent public acts of racial control and domination and the perpetrators were never held accountable.\n\nThe reparations could come in a variety of forms, according to the panel, including \u201ca formal apology, health initiatives, educational opportunities ... psychological rehabilitation, technology transfer and financial support, and debt cancellation.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, such initiatives are nowhere in the cards, even after the question of reparations arose again two years ago when surfaced by the groundbreaking work of American journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n\nSeparately, a coalition of Caribbean nations is calling for reparations from their former European imperial powers for the impact of slavery, colonial genocide and the toxic racial laws that shaped life for the past two centuries in these countries. Their efforts are fitful, and so far not so fruitful.\n\nWhen asked by reporters to comment on the tone of the American presidential election campaign on Monday, the working group's chairman, Ricardo A. Sunga of the Philippines, expressed concern about \u201chate speech ... xenophobia [and] Afrophobia\u201d that he felt was prevalent in the campaign, although he didn't specifically call out Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are very troubled that these are on the rise,\u201d said Sunga.\n\nThe Washington Post",

    "title": "When Trump said not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019 undecided voters in North Carolina gasped",
    "text": "CARY, N.C. \u2014 Donald Trump so captured Ron Townley\u2019s attention as \u201can outsider ready to tear down the system,\u201d just the one who might break the Washington logjam, the doer to build new airports and highways, that he was considering voting for him.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s response Monday night when Hillary Clinton accused him of not paying a cent of federal tax left Townley appalled.\n\n\u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d Trump said, unapologetic and smiling, during the presidential debate, held in Hempstead, N.Y.\n\nThat comment caused a gasp in the hotel conference room where Townley and five other undecided voters in this \u00adbattleground state were watching the debate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s offensive. I pay taxes,\u201d said Townley, 52, a program \u00addirector for a local council of governments.\n\n\u201cAnother person would be in jail for that,\u201d said Jamilla Hawkins, 33, who was sitting beside him in the Crescent conference room at the Embassy Suites in this city of 150,000 near Raleigh.\n\nHawkins\u2019s mother had chided her to get off the fence and support Clinton, but the 33-year-old felt no connection to the Democratic nominee. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t sold on her. A lot of my friends were on the Bernie Sanders train,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Hawkins said the debate made her appreciate Clinton more. She said she now leans toward voting for her \u2014 a feeling shared by most of the undecided voters gathered here for an informal focus group.\n\nUndecided voter Jamilla Hawkins (Ted Richardson/The Washington Post)\n\nPolls show that the race between Clinton and Trump is deadlocked in North Carolina, a once solidly conservative state that has seesawed between Republicans and Democrats in recent years and is too tight to call for either candidate.\n\nMany say the race will come down to undecided voters such as Townley and Hawkins \u2014 those committed to voting but not yet to a candidate. In North Carolina, the undecideds amount to about 10 percent of the electorate, according to surveys; in other parts of the country their numbers are even higher.\n\nMost voters in this polarized election support either Trump or Clinton and couldn\u2019t possibly consider voting for their rival. Yet there are a significant number who see attractive qualities and flaws in each of the two major-party candidates and have not yet decided whom to choose.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday showed that 17 percent of registered voters said the debate might change their minds about which candidate to support; 6 percent said there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d the debate could do so.\n\nThe undecided voters gathered here Monday by The Washington Post were from all over the state; they were in Cary to attend a Rural Center conference, where gubernatorial and Senate candidates were among the speakers.\n\nEach of the men and women said they had not yet found a candidate to rally around because they found fault with both. But after the debate, four of the six undecided voters said they now leaned toward Clinton after she showed mastery of the issues and appeared more presidential. A fifth voter declared himself essentially now in the Clinton\u2019s camp: \u201cAfter tonight, I think I am convinced, I will vote for Clinton,\u201d said the Rev. Kelly Andrews, a Baptist pastor from Tarboro.\n\nCindy Adair said that the 90-minute debate did not help her at all. She still abhors some of the policies that Clinton has supported, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which destroyed the textile industry that Adair grew up in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d she said as Clinton, under attack for the trade agreement blamed for sending jobs overseas, insisted that domestic manufacturing jobs increased in the 1990s.\n\nClinton \u201clooked snarky\u201d at times, Adair said \u2014 though she did think she looked \u201cmore professional\u201d than Trump. She said she didn\u2019t find Clinton\u2019s better performance surprising given that the former U.S. senator and secretary of state is a \u201ccareer politician\u201d practiced in this kind of forum.\n\nAdair, a registered Republican, said she likes that Trump says he will reduce taxes. She thinks it is a big mistake that Clinton will \u00adcontinue the Affordable Care Act \u201cand the move toward socialist health care.\u201d\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, Adair said, Clinton scored a 5 and Trump a 2. By the evening\u2019s end, she was still at a loss about whom to support on Nov. 8.\n\nThe others watching the televised debate had new problems with Trump after listening to him one-on-one for an extended time. They said he appeared racist in some of his remarks about African Americans, not as prepared and rude in his frequent interruptions of Clinton.\n\nWhen Trump gloated about not paying taxes, many called it a huge mistake. Clinton accused him of hiding something by not publicly releasing his federal tax returns, and she noted that some returns seen by state authorities showed that he had paid no federal taxes.\n\nHawkins, 33, who works in community development, said that gave her a new view of the Republican candidate: that he is out of touch with the ordinary middle-class person who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s right for the rich to not pay their share of taxes.\n\n\u201cHe started out okay, but then after 30 minutes, he started attacking. He is inconsistent and doesn\u2019t have the temperament,\u201d she said.\n\nHawkins\u2019s eyes widened with incredulity at Trump\u2019s unexpected answer about the culprit behind recent cyberattacks: \u201cIt could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d she said, calling it childish and offensive to those with weight problems.\n\nHawkins\u2019s main issue with Clinton \u2014 her difficulty relating to ordinary voters \u2014 hasn\u2019t disappeared. But she has many more issues with Trump.\n\nAmy Bridges, 49, who voted for President Obama in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2014 a mirror of how this state went \u2014 was troubled by Trump\u2019s inability to keep his attention focused.\n\n\u201cHe cannot stay on topic,\u201d she said when Trump started talking about the Islamic State after he was asked about his call for Obama to produce his birth certificate to prove he is a natural-born citizen. \u201cI just want you to answer the questions!\u201d she said at another point.\n\nBefore the debate, Bridges \u00addiscussed her reservations about Clinton, especially \u201cthe feeling that she was untrustworthy.\u201d But afterward, she said: \u201cIt was far more obvious she knows her stuff. I feel a bit more comfortable with her.\u201d\n\nAndrews, the Baptist pastor, said he had been attracted to Trump\u2019s business experience and his understanding that people are upset about manufacturing jobs being sent overseas. He said that his wife lost her job when a plant that made tools and drills closed. But as he listened to Trump on Monday night, he started shouting at the TV screen.\n\n\u201cStop-and-frisk is unconstitutional!\u201d he hollered. Andrews, who is African American, said that Trump\u2019s call for the controversial policing practice to instill \u201claw and order\u201d would allow officers to frisk any black person.\n\nTrump also said that African Americans and Hispanics in urban areas are \u201cliving in hell because it\u2019s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAndrews found that statement ridiculous.\n\nJohn York, a tech consultant, said the bottom line for him was that Trump gave few details and \u201cshowed he really doesn\u2019t have a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very big highlight for me was when Hillary tried to assure the world\u201d rattled by this \u00adelection, York said. Trump talked about ripping up trade and other \u00adinternational agreements, while \u00adClinton promised that the United States would honor its defense treaties and said \u201cour word is good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people want change, but they are not ready to flush the whole system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Washington Post",

    "text": "The men who decided England manager Sam Allardyce had to go made the painful decision in an effort to preserve the Football Association's integrity as \"guardians of the game\".\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke and chief executive Martin Glenn met with Allardyce at Wembley on Tuesday and left the 61-year-old in no doubt he had reached the end of a short road with the national side.\n\nAllardyce ultimately agreed to terminate his contract, having been left in an untenable position by a Daily Telegraph sting operation that captured him negotiating lucrative speaking engagements in the Far East as well as making indiscreet and damaging remarks about a range of issues including third-party ownership.\n\nAmong the names linked with replacing Allardyce at Wembley, caretaker manager Gareth Southgate and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe feature prominently.\n\nFormer Hull City manager Steve Bruce, too, is in contention while German coach Jurgen Klinsmann is again linked with the vacant post.\n\nGlenn, who led the three-man panel that nominated Allardyce in the summer, told FATV: \"It has been a really painful decision because obviously we've only just hired Sam.\n\n\"We've concluded - and Sam's agreed - that his behaviour has been inappropriate and, frankly, not what is expected of an England manager.\n\n\"Sam, we think, is a great fit for England manager and we think could have been extremely successful.\n\n\"But the FA's more than just running the England men's team. We have to stand up for the right behaviours across the whole game. We're the guardians of the game, we set the rules.\n\n\"We have to be seen to apply those rules consistently and evenly, whether you're the England manager or someone low down in the organisation.\"\n\nWho should replace Allardyce as England manager?

    "title": "Shimon Peres witnessed Israel's history - and helped to shape it",
    "text": "At every corner of Israel's tumultuous history, Shimon Peres was there.\n\nHe was a young aide to the nation's founding fathers when the country declared independence in 1948, and he played a key role in turning Israel into a military power. He was part of the negotiations that sealed the first Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, garnering a Nobel Peace Prize. He was welcomed like royalty in world capitals.\n\nBut only at the end of a political career stretching more than 60 years did Peres finally win the widespread admiration of his own people that had eluded him for so long. He died at 93 early Wednesday, his son, Chemi, confirmed at the hospital where Shimon Peres had been treated for the past two weeks.\n\nPeres began a new chapter at age 83, assuming the nation's presidency following a scandal that forced his predecessor to step down. The job cemented Peres' transformation from down-and-dirty political operator to elder statesman.\n\n\u201cAfter such a long career, let me just say something: My appetite to manage is over. My inclination to dream and to envisage is greater,\u201d Peres told The Associated Press in an interview on July 15, 2007, moments before he was sworn in as president.\n\nHe said he would not allow his age, or the constraints of a largely ceremonial office, to slow him down. \u201cI'm not in a hurry to pass away,\u201d Peres said. \u201cThe day will come that I shall not forget to pass away. But until then, I'm not going to waste my life.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement mourning the passing of Peres. He said he will convene his Cabinet for a special session later in the day.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said they had \u201clost a true and treasured friend\u201d with the death of Shimon Peres. Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush also issued statements of mourning, as did former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nAs president, Peres tirelessly jetted around the world to represent his country at conferences, ceremonies and international gatherings.\n\nHe was a fixture at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland, where he was treated like a rock star as the world's rich and powerful listened breathlessly to his every word, on topics ranging from Mideast peace to nanotechnology to the wonders of the human brain.\n\nHe also became Israel's moderate face at a time when the nation was led by hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Peres sought to reassure the international community that Israel seeks peace, despite concerns over continued settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and the paralysis of negotiations under Netanyahu. Still, while Peres never tired of speaking of peace, he tended to avoid strident criticism of Netanyahu.\n\nIt was his 1994 Nobel Prize that established Peres' man-of-peace image. He proudly displayed the prize \u2014 which he shared with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat \u2014 on the desk of his presidential office.\n\nAs foreign minister, Peres secretly brokered the historic Oslo interim peace accords with the Palestinians, signed at the White House on Sept. 13, 1993.\n\nAccepting the award, he told assembled dignitaries that \u201cwar, as a method of conducting human affairs, is in its death throes, and the time has come to bury it.\u201d\n\nDespite the assassination of Rabin, the breakdown of peace talks, a second Palestinian uprising in 2000, wars in Lebanon and Gaza, and Netanyahu's continued re-elections, Peres maintained his insistence that peace was right around the corner.\n\n\u201cI'm sure I shall see peace in my lifetime. Even if I should have to extend my life for a year or two, I won't hesitate,\u201d he said in a 2013 interview marking his 90th birthday.\n\nPeres was born Shimon Perski on Aug. 2, 1923 in Vishniev, then part of Poland and now in Belarus. He moved to pre-state Palestine in 1934 with his family, where he changed his surname to Peres, or songbird, in Hebrew. Relatives who remained in Poland, including his grandfather, a prominent rabbi, were killed when Nazis set a synagogue on fire during the Holocaust. Peres often spoke lovingly of his grandfather in speeches. The actress Lauren Bacall was a cousin.\n\nStill in his 20s, Peres rose quickly through the ranks of Israel's pre-state leadership, and served as a top aide to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, after independence in 1948. Peres once called Ben-Gurion \u201cthe greatest Jew of our time.\u201d\n\nAt 29, he served as director of Israel's Defense Ministry, and is credited with arming Israel's military almost from scratch. He later worked with the French to develop Israel's nuclear program, which today is widely believed to include a large arsenal of bombs.\n\nStill, he suffered throughout his political career from the fact that he never wore an army uniform or fought in a war.\n\nPeres was elected to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in 1959, serving in nearly all major Cabinet posts over his long career. As finance minister, he imposed an emergency plan to halt triple-digit inflation in the 1980s. He also was an early supporter of the Jewish settler movement in the West Bank, a position he would later abandon.\n\nBut he had trouble breaking into the prime minister's post, the top job in Israeli politics. He was hampered by a reputation among the public and fellow politicians as both a utopian dreamer and a political schemer.\n\nHe ran for prime minister in five general elections, losing four and tying one, in 1984, when he shared the job in a rotation with his rival Yitzhak Shamir.\n\nHis well-tailored, neck-tied appearance, swept-back gray hair and penchant for artists and intellectuals seemed to separate him from his more informal countrymen. He never lost his Polish accent, making him a target for mimicry.\n\nOne of the lowest points of his political career came in 1990, when he led his Labor Party out of a unity government with Shamir's hardline Likud on the strength of promises from small factions to support his bid to replace Shamir.\n\nAt the last minute, several members of Parliament changed their minds, approving a Shamir government without Peres and Labor. The incident became known in Israeli political lore as Peres' \u201cstinking maneuver.\u201d Rabin scorned him as a \u201crelentless meddler\u201d and in 1992 replaced him as party leader.\n\nThe two eventually repaired their relationship and worked together on pursuing peace with the Palestinians.\n\nAfter Rabin's assassination by a Jewish ultranationalist opposed to Israel's peace moves, Peres became acting prime minister.\n\nBut he failed to capitalize on the widespread sympathy for the fallen leader and lost a razor-thin election the following year to Netanyahu.\n\nIn one famous incident, an angry Peres rhetorically asked a gathering of his Labor Party whether he was a \u201closer.\u201d Resounding calls of \u201cyes\u201d rained down on him.\n\nPeres would later blame a wave of suicide bombings for his defeat. He described his visit to the scene of a deadly bus explosion in Jerusalem, where people started screaming \u201ckiller\u201d and \u201cmurderer\u201d at him. \u201cI knew that I lost the election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe suffered another humiliation in 2000 when he ran for the presidency, a largely ceremonial position elected by Parliament. Peres believed he had wrapped up the election, but the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party broke a promise to him and switched its support to Likud candidate Moshe Katsav. Peres was a loser once again.\n\nEven so, he refused to quit. In 2001, he took the post of foreign minister in a unity government led by his rival Ariel Sharon, serving for 20 months before Labor withdrew from the coalition. In Peres' final political defeat, Labor overthrew him as party leader in 2005, choosing instead the little-known Amir Peretz.\n\nPeres subsequently followed Sharon into a new party, Kadima, serving as vice-premier and maintaining that post under Sharon's successor, Ehud Olmert.\n\nHe was able to attain the presidency when Katsav was forced to step down weeks before his term ended to face rape charges. Katsav was later convicted and sent to prison.\n\nSeeking to stabilize the cherished institution, Parliament turned to Peres and elected him president.\n\nPeres cultivated an image as a grandfatherly figure, frequently inviting groups of children and teens to the presidential residence. He embraced social media and promoted Israel's high-tech industry in meetings with top officials at Google, Facebook and other major companies.\n\nPeres also launched his \u201cPresident's Conference,\u201d which became an annual high-powered gathering in Jerusalem of artists, thinkers and business leaders from around the world.\n\nDerided by critics as extravagant and unnecessary, the gathering drew some of the world's most powerful personalities. The 2013 conference also became a 90th birthday party, with figures such as Bill Clinton, Barbara Streisand and Robert DeNiro in attendance.\n\nHe also exhibited a humorous side. When he left the presidency in 2014, he appeared in a video his granddaughter produced where he jokingly tried out new jobs including a supermarket cashier, gas station attendant and standup comedian \u2014 peppering his comments with puns and visionary slogans.\n\nAsked about his secret to longevity, Peres said he never dwelled on the past.\n\n\u201cWhat happened until now is over, unchangeable. I'm not going to spend time on it. So I am really living in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think that one should devote his energies to make the world better and not to make the past remembered better.\u201d\n\nPeres' wife Sonya died in 2011. He leaves a daughter, Tsvia Valdan, a university professor, and two sons, Nehemia, a leading Israeli venture capitalist, and Yonatan, a veterinarian.\n\nPeres represented \u201cthe essence of Israel itself,\u201d President Barack Obama said.\n\n\u201cThere are few people who we share this world with who change the course of human history, not just through their role in human events, but because they expand our moral imagination and force us to expect more of ourselves. My friend Shimon was one of those people,\u201d he said. \u201cA light has gone out, but the hope he gave us will burn forever.\u201d\n\nAP",

    "text": "Writers on the Range An argument against internet access in parks Tethered by their devices, \u201cyounglings\u201d of today don\u2019t want to camp.\n\nBackpacking was made popular by the dropout generation in the 1960s. We were going to eschew the trappings of civilization and live intimately with Mother Nature. All things natural were good and groovy (except maybe hemlock and arsenic and stuff like that). Turn on (to nature), tune in, and drop out, baby.\n\nToday, backpacking has leveled off. Baby boomers, those hippies of yore, are too old to sleep on the ground. The younglings of today want to get into the wilderness, but they don\u2019t want to camp. They need to return to civilization by nightfall so they can plug in their devices.\n\nThe Park Service plans to implement high-speed internet in all national parks by 2018. Visitors, it seems, complain that they cannot access their devices when visiting the parks. On social media, novice hikers seek advice on recommended solar panels to recharge their gadgets. Some new backpacks have built-in solar panels. So much for ultralight travel.\n\nBrook Ward, Flickr user.\n\nMy generation disparaged civilization. Today\u2019s hikers revel in it, indeed, demand it. Take music. The ubiquitous iPod rides in a tiny arm pack, streaming tunes as one marches along. If the iPod-user has ear buds, it is not my concern, unless the hiker is trampled or eaten because he or she can\u2019t hear an oncoming elk or bear. But that is natural selection at work. Exterior speakers are my concern.\n\nMore hikers carry \u201cweatherproof\u201d speakers on their packs so they can share the love. But natural quiet is impaired when tinny music pumps from every corner. If you cannot be alone with your thoughts for more than five minutes, keep it to yourself.\n\nTake cellphones. More backcountry places are phone-accessible. In emergencies, this can be a lifesaver. Often, however, Search and Rescue responds to \u201clife-threatening\u201d calls that involve blisters or ennui.\n\nMost phone calls on the trail seem to be made because hikers are bored. \u201cHi, guess where I\u2019m calling from!\u201d Or even, \u201cDid that repairman ever show up?\u201d I don't know why it is more irritating to listen to someone prattling away to an invisible person than it is to hear them chatting to a companion who is actually present, but there it is. I am currently spreading the rumor that talking on the phone while hiking attracts predators.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s texting. Kids don\u2019t even look at their surroundings if they can text to their friends, mail their selfies, their updates, and their instant pics and videos, then check their \u201clikes.\u201d Perhaps it doesn\u2019t really happen unless everyone knows about it in real time. Again, it\u2019s not my problem, unless, while texting, they inadvertently walk off a cliff or into a hot spring.\n\nIt does seem a shame that these busy hikers aren\u2019t satisfied by the real world. Our wild areas are becoming more crowded. The national parks all had record visitation last year, and this year seems to have been the same. Wouldn\u2019t it be more, I don\u2019t know, appropriate, to appreciate where one is, rather than making sure everyone knows what one is doing? To be in the moment, rather than adding up one\u2019s online hits?\n\nThe difference between a traveler and a tourist has been defined thusly: The traveler wishes to experience the area visited. The tourist wants to be able to say he/she was there. The traveler looks and feels and experiences. The tourist posts online and waits for the emojis.\n\nThe traveler sits and listens to the wind. The tourist cranks up the speakers. The traveler contemplates the void and shares insights with companions. The tourist chats with his/her broker on the phone.\n\nThe traveler writes in a journal. The tourist uploads to the world. The traveler is changed by the experience. The tourist rushes from place to place to get more and more selfies. The traveler considers what he/she has learned and plans a longer follow-up visit. The tourist checks off one more item on a bucket list.\n\nIs it hopelessly old fogeyish to suggest that mindfulness is part of the wilderness experience? There is the opportunity to revel in your surroundings. Observe the clouds. Harken to the birds. Or at least turn off those speakers so the rest of us can harken to the birds.

    "title": "Healers cure mistrust in Guinea's health system after horrors of Ebola",
    "text": "Dressed in a stripy shirt and white skullcap, Mory Kaba roots around behind bottles of mysterious dark liquids and pulls out a small package. A new patient has just arrived at the traditional healer\u2019s shop in Kissidougou.\n\n\n\nKaba\u2019s table is spread with khaki-coloured powders and brown pellets. His patient, a middle aged woman with \u00a31 to spend, has fever, stomach pain, a headache and sore feet. He sells her a twist of yellow powder, gives her instructions, and writes down the sale in his ledger.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019ve tried two or three times to cure someone and nothing works, then I send them to the hospital,\u201d Kaba says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this lady before, but I have treated these symptoms in the past, so I\u2019m giving it a go.\u201d\n\n\n\nMotorbikes cocooned in bubble wrap whizz past his wooden walls: they are all protected against the rain like this in Guinea, where despite its mineral wealth and fertile land the poverty is relentless as its downpours.\n\n\n\nTraditional healers, who in this west African country mainly forage for remedies in the forest, are believed to be the first port of call for around 80% of sick Guineans. A dire shortage of health workers means there is not much competition for these men and women who live in the communities they treat. They are thought to have divine powers, and enjoy unquestioning trust.\n\n\n\nThis trust proved crucial during the Ebola outbreak, when traditional healers were persuaded to refer patients to treatment centres and were taught how to stop it spreading.\n\n\n\nNow, the government is considering trying to integrate traditional healers into the healthcare systems more generally in Guinea, to help fight other diseases including malaria, cholera, meningitis and measles.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mory Kaba, a traditional healer, in his shop in Kissidougou. Photograph: Kate Holt\n\n\u201cWe believe that they should be part of the health system. Better to organise them, and rely on them as a surveillance system,\u201d says Guy Yogo, Unicef\u2019s deputy representative in Guinea, who is in discussions with the government about bringing them into the fold. \u201cIf the government agrees that they should be part of the health system, then my view is that it\u2019s worth investing, because they are not asking a lot. When people are organised, they comply more easily. If we leave them outside the health system, they won\u2019t comply.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Ebola outbreak, which killed more than 11,000 people and was only finally declared over in Guinea in June, was a terrifying experience for those who lived through, or near it. Doctors and nurses were dying, medicine ran out and clinics closed their doors. Family members would suddenly die horrible deaths. Strangers in alien-looking suits would come to take away the bodies \u2013 bodies that should, according to important local customs, have been touched and washed and buried by the community. Rather than traditional white shrouds, bodies were buried in black bags \u2013 something Guineans believed would surely send them straight to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe pharmacies were empty. There were no more drugs \u2013 nothing! Traditional healers were the only option,\u201d Yogo says.\n\n\n\nHowever, in some cases their attempts to treat Ebola made the situation worse, as they contracted the virus themselves and passed it on to patients.\n\n\n\nOne study found that an explosion of Ebola cases stemmed from a well-known healer who had tried to treat the virus and died. Then, 14 women caught the disease at her funeral, just over the border in Sierra Leone, and spread it throughout their communities.\n\n\n\n'My hope is that there is more peace here': life after Ebola \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nIn a shady clearing in Kissidougou, a tall man in a white coat with a Christmas tree drawn in felt-tip on the chest presides over a meeting of dozens of elderly healers \u2013 men and women \u2013 with Hawa Sakho, a Unicef representative.\n\n\u201cPeople always start with us. During Ebola, I called all of the traditional healers and told them that if someone is sick, to see if it\u2019s Ebola and send them to the hospital,\u201d says Fakoly Kourouma, the president of a local association of healers. \u201cPeople were scared of the hospitals, though. We tried to convince them. Sometimes I took patients there myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, many healers are used to passing patients on to the hospitals, and they do it for other diseases they cannot treat. Referring patients to health centres, however, is not necessarily a sound financial strategy for a healer.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult, because it took work and money away from them,\u201d Yogo says.\n\n\n\nThe healers don\u2019t always see themselves in competition with health services, though.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe hospitals can treat some things we can\u2019t and vice versa,\u201d Kourouma says. \u201cIf someone puts a curse on you, we can treat you \u2013 the hospital can\u2019t. If you have a broken leg, we put something on it and touch it and a few days later it\u2019s fixed \u2026 \u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Unicef\u2019s Sakho explains how the organisation works with the healers so that the sick get the treatment they need. \u201cMost of the time we do training with them \u2013 how to treat a patient, hygiene, when a patient is in the house, you need to put them in a separate room from your family \u2013 things like that.\u201d\n\nThis helped stem the spread of Ebola in communities, but also protected the healers themselves. Laye Mamady Doumbouya, a traditional healer in Siguiri, made a narrow escape.\n\n\n\nFor years the sick, the impotent and the cursed have visited him at his modest compound to buy his medicine. He is blind and sits, surrounded by peanut shells and flies, in the plastic chair where he has sat in for many years, waiting for patients.\n\n\n\nSocial stigma compounds desperate poverty of Guinea's Ebola survivors | Billie Adwoa McTernan Read more\n\nOne night in 2014, Doumbouya\u2019s household had been asleep for hours when a patient arrived, brought by friends.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told them that I didn\u2019t have enough space in my house, so I couldn\u2019t accept him that night,\u201d Doumbouya says. \u201cThey spent the night in their car, and when I woke up in the morning I noticed that they were still there. So I sent my sons to look for medicine leaves in the bush so that I could treat him, but by the time my sons came back, the man had already died.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man, it turned out, had run away from home after his mother died from Ebola and he was listed as a contact. Doumbouya had never seen anybody with Ebola before, though he had heard of the disease, and his precaution of not touching the man and not letting him in the house probably saved his family, who were quarantined immediately.\n\n\n\n\u201cLuckily, none of my family got sick, but we were victims of stigma,\u201d he says. \u201cNeighbours avoided my family and people stayed away from my wife when she went to the market.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbola was a terrifying disease, and has understandably made people suspicious.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor people to start using the health system again, trust will have to be rebuilt,\u201d says Yogo. \u201cPeople wanted good answers about Ebola \u2013 why was there this disease, and why couldn\u2019t the health workers deal with it? Ebola was a really scary disease.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe believes that traditional healers are ideally placed to help restore confidence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are the first-line counsellor in communities. The community believes they hold some sort of divine power. They are well-respected, and they\u2019ve been effective helping us lifting resistance and rebuilding trust in the communities.\u201d",

    "title": "Short Order: Roasted Tomato Salsa",
    "text": "When I worked for a brief time in the thriving field of packaged meals, a phrase my bosses liked to toss around was \u201cshelf stable.\u201d They were referring to a product that would last at room temperature or in a fridge or freezer without going bad.\n\nWhen it comes to salsas, most of the store-bought ones achieve shelf stability by adding citric or ascorbic acid, additives that make the product last longer, but leave an unpleasant aftertaste.\n\nIf you make your own salsas, you can achieve a certain amount of shelf stability by cooking your ingredients. The enemy of a stable salsa is water content. Onions, tomatoes and peppers are full of water, and when you cut them up and add salt, you draw the water out, and eventually end up with something that looks less like a salsa and more like a soup.\n\nA solution to the water content issue is to cook the vegetables. Cooking draws out the water and also concentrates the flavor, giving you a sauce that will last refrigerated for a week.\n\nAt Avelina, we prepare this salsa by baking our vegetables in our wood oven, which also gives them a deep flavor.\n\nThis is the idea sauce for a piece of grilled chicken or a juicy fish like striped bass or Alaskan halibut.\n\nRoasted Tomato Salsa\n\nMakes about 1 quart\n\nIngredients\n\n2 ripe tomatoes, halved\n\n4 poblano peppers\n\n1 red or yellow onion, sliced into 1 inch pieces\n\n1 tablespoon fresh or 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n\n4 tablepoons extra virgin olive oil\n\n1 tablespoon capers ( optional)\n\n2 teaspoons roasted cracked cumin\n\n4 tablespoons cilantro or mint\n\n1 tablespoon sherry or red wine vinegar\n\n4 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves\n\njuice of 1 lime\n\nfew shots hot sauce (optional)\n\nsalt\n\nDirections\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Place the tomatoes, onion and poblano peppers on a baking sheet and season with half the olive oil, the oregano and a pinch of salt. Bake until the poblanos are blistered and the onions are golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven and allow to cool enough until the vegetables can be handled.\n\nHalve the poblano peppers, remove the stem end and the seeds and cut in a large dice. Place in a mixing bowl. Discard the skin from the tomatoes and dice. Add the tomatoes and their juices (including any juices from the baking sheet). Cut the onions in a large dice.\n\nAdd the remaining olive oil, the vinegar, cilantro, lime juice and a pinch of salt. Add the hot sauce and capers if using.\n\nServe with fish or chicken.",

    "title": "The versatile baked pancake that\u2019s just as sweet when it\u2019s savory",
    "text": "For all the years that I\u2019ve eaten, baked and loved Dutch baby pancakes, I was oblivious to one important thing: their name. Then, last week, a friend told me that her sons \u201cfreaked out when I told them we were eating Dutch babies!\u201d I don\u2019t think I had parsed the name before.\n\nMaybe I\u2019d had my first Dutch baby before I was aware of such things. Maybe I wasn\u2019t as curious as those boys when I was a youngster. Or maybe I was just so anxious to scarf down the dish that I never stopped to question what it was called.\n\nThanks to them, I\u2019ve done a little searching, and I now know a little more about this.\n\nFirst, to describe a Dutch baby: In its most usual incarnation, it resembles a sweet popover. It\u2019s a quickly made batter that\u2019s poured into a hot skillet and baked until the edges rise above the sides of the pan, with mountains and valleys in the center. Sometimes a Dutch baby involves sauteed apples; often it involves confectioners\u2019 sugar. Watching it in the oven always involves wonderment, as its rise is spectacular, and typically involves disappointment upon delivery, as a Dutch baby\u2019s belly flattens quickly.\n\nAlthough the traditional Dutch baby is best known as a breakfast treat or a dessert, my current fave is savory, meant as a nibble with drinks, a brunch dish or a first course at dinner. It has herbs in the batter and scallions on top, and it\u2019s good served with ricotta, sour cream, salsa, grated cheese or a salad. It\u2019s also good with wine \u2013 red or white, sparkling or not.\n\nMy dip into the dish\u2019s history revealed that, sweet or savory, the name has nothing to do with Holland and Dutch people but rather with the Pennsylvania Dutch, whose \u201cDutch\u201d is a corruption of Deutsch (German).\n\nWikipedia, citing Sunset magazine, says a cafe in Seattle originated the Dutch baby and owned the trademark for it at least as early as 1942. Since then, the pancake has made itself at home all over the country, including chez me. (That fact wasn\u2019t in Wiki.) This is the kind of dish you make once and then make over and over, because it hits all the marks: It\u2019s easy, it looks great, it\u2019s delicious and it\u2019s just about infinitely play-aroundable.\n\nTakeaway tips\n\nChoose a heavy, ovenproof skillet. My two favorites for this recipe are an old-fashioned cast-iron skillet or an only slightly less old-fashioned enamel-over-cast-iron.\n\nThe technique of heating the pan and the butter in a hot oven is key to the baby\u2019s puff. Keep an eye on the butter: It should bubble but not brown.\n\nYou can mix the batter by hand; I did for years. But it\u2019s better when you use a blender. You want to be sure the flour is completely incorporated.\n\nAdd the herbs only after the batter is smooth. The idea is to blend them into the batter, not to emulsify them. Choose whatever herbs you like or have on hand.\n\nWhen you pour the batter into the hot pan, the butter will be pushed up the sides and may even cover part of the batter, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nLay the scallions over the batter, and don\u2019t fuss with them. You want to get the pan back into the oven as quickly as you can.\n\nYou can swap the scallions for other finely cut vegetables. Think leeks, carrot ribbons, zucchini rounds, broccoli rabe, asparagus, snow peas or lightly steamed broccoli or cauliflower.\n\nServe the pancake nanoseconds after it comes from the oven. It can go to the table as is or topped with something creamy, cheesy or green. Put a pouf of salad on top, and you\u2019ve got a great brunch/lunch dish.\n\nIf you\u2019re Dutch babying for kids, sit them in front of the oven so they can watch the batter rise \u2013 it\u2019s like time-lapse animation \u2013 and then christen the dish \u201cMagic Pancake.\u201d I think the pancake\u2019s creators would be fine with that. I know the children will be.\n\nDorie Greenspan\u2019s Herb and Scallion Dutch Baby\n\n4 main-course servings or 8 starter servings\n\nTo serve this as an hors d\u2019oeuvre, you can cut it into bite-size pieces and serve it straight from the pan, with toothpicks.\n\nFrom cookbook author Dorie Greenspan.\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the pancake\n\n4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces\n\n3/4 cup whole milk\n\n3 large eggs\n\n3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n3/4 cup flour\n\n1/4 cup minced mixed herbs, such as chives, basil, thyme and/or oregano\n\n4 to 6 scallions (trimmed), white part and 1 to 2 inches of green, halved lengthwise\n\nFor the toppings (optional)\n\nPlain yogurt\n\nRicotta cheese\n\nSour cream\n\nLightly dressed green salad\n\nTomato salsa\n\nHot sauce\n\nMixed fresh herbs\n\nSprinkling of grated cheese\n\nSteps\n\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the butter in a 9- or 10-inch ovenproof skillet.\n\nSlide the skillet into the oven; bake (middle rack) until the butter is melted and bubbling. Keep on eye on this: You don\u2019t want to brown the butter. Start the batter as soon as the pan goes into the oven.\n\nCombine the milk, eggs, salt and pepper in the blender; puree until well incorporated. Add the flour and mix, diligently scraping the sides and bottom of the container, until it is evenly incorporated. Add the herbs, and pulse only until incorporated.\n\nRemove the skillet from the oven. Rap the blender jar or bowl against the counter to get rid of some of the batter\u2019s bubbles, then pour the batter into the hot skillet. Scatter the halved scallions over the top, and quickly return the pan to the oven.\n\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the pancake is golden brown and puffed above the skillet\u2019s rim. The middle of the pancake will be puffed, and a skewer inserted into the center should come out clean or with just a bit of custard clinging to it.\n\nCut and serve right away, either plain or with any of the optional toppings. The pancake collapses quickly, but even then, it\u2019s beautiful.\n\nNutrition | Per serving (based on 4): 270 calories, 9 g protein, 21 g carbohydrates, 17 g fat, 9 g saturated fat, 175 mg cholesterol, 480 mg sodium, 0 g dietary fiber, 3 g sugar\n\nDorrie Greenspan is the award-winning author of 12 cookbooks, including the recent \u201cBaking Chez Moi\u201d and the upcoming \u201cDorie\u2019s Cookies.\u201d Read more on her Web site, doriegreenspan.com.",

    "text": "Dear Amy: I am an adult professional woman with two teenage children. I am divorced, and the survivor of an abusive alcoholic mother.\n\nI have been through years of counseling and have struggled with anxiety my entire life. My relationship with my mother has always been my burden.\n\nAs my children have gotten older, my mom\u2019s health has deteriorated. She doesn\u2019t call or attend birthday parties or sporting events, and tries to put the burden on me. I have not had a mother for most of my life and she doesn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nNow that she is sick from her chosen lifestyle, she wants again to pull us toward her because she needs us, not because she wants to make amends or apologize.\n\nPeople view me as cold-hearted, but I let her abuse me until I had children and only then was I able to pull away. All I ever wanted was for her to love me.\n\nShe has broken my heart so many times and affected all of my relationships because when the only person on earth who is supposed to love you abuses and rejects you, you\u2019re afraid to love.\n\nI\u2019m going to a psychiatrist and a counselor and they say to protect myself and to go with my heart. I\u2019m so conflicted. I really don\u2019t like her, but she is my mother. I\u2019ve spent 46 years of my life trying to please her, and she just disappoints me.\n\nWhat do you think? Do I keep trying, or just move on with my life?\n\n\u2014 Angry in Iowa\n\nDear Angry: Moving on starts with acceptance. You need to accept your bad luck at growing up in the household of an alcoholic parent. You deserved better \u2014 everyone does \u2014 but you didn\u2019t get the parent you deserved to have (but your own children did \u2014 lucky them!).\n\nPlease don\u2019t let your childhood define you for the rest of your life. Being a good parent and a good person should define you now.\n\nAfter acceptance, you work on detachment. You can\u2019t fix your mother, and you can\u2019t change her. You cannot rewrite the past, you can\u2019t rewire your mother\u2019s brain, and you can\u2019t cure her disease.\n\nYou should attempt to have the relationship YOU want to have \u2014 and that includes no relationship.\n\nYour desire to fix things, while wrestling with conflicted feelings, is common for adult children of alcoholics. In addition to your therapy, you should research and seek support from others who understand your challenges, through Al-anon or another support group.\n\nRead \u201cAfter the Tears: Helping Adult Children of Alcoholics Heal Their Childhood Trauma,\u201d by Jane Middleton-Moz and Lorie Dwinell. (HCI, 2010).\n\nDear Amy: I am currently living with my daughter, her hubby and their children. I came here because when my husband passed away, I was unable to get an apartment.\n\nMy daughter and her husband graciously offered a room to me; it was a good feeling to know I wasn\u2019t alone at this time.\n\nI feel that the time has come for me to move on. Unfortunately, this brings up the problem of finances.\n\nI have been living on Social Security, and now with the upcoming presidential election, there is a lot of talk about this program and others being cut back, or worse, cut completely.\n\nI\u2019m so confused. I don\u2019t want to make a bigger mistake by moving out. This is not a decision that I can just jump into. What do you think I should do?\n\n\u2014 Running in Circles\n\nDear Running: You should enlist your daughter\u2019s help to research housing options in your area. Where I live, you can apply for subsidized housing specifically intended for low-income seniors.\n\nIt is sensible to try to anticipate possible changes in your benefits, but I don\u2019t think Social Security is going to go away anytime soon.\n\nRegardless, you should do your research and apply soon \u2014 the process might take several months.\n\nMoving into a community of elders could be a positive life change for you, and I hope you\u2019ll bravely try to make this happen.\n\nDear Amy: \u201cWorried\u201d is an 11-year-old girl whose father recently died. The letter and your compassionate response moved me.\n\nIn addition to your recommendations, readers should know that hospices often offer grief groups for children. I hope her mother looks into this for her.\n\n\u2014 Touched\n\nDear Touched: Thank you for the reminder of how important and helpful hospice programs are \u2014 before and after a loved one\u2019s death.",

Isaias Afewerki, the former leader of the liberation struggle, is still in power 25 years later, and a resumption of hostilities with Ethiopia at the turn of the millennium inflicted huge human and economic damage on the country, exacerbating its slide into a military state.\n\nIn the capital, although bicycles and charming old European cars dot the roads and the ambitious Italian colonial-era architecture is well preserved, more than a dozen people said they were desperately gathering cash to pay for sigre dob (border crossing).\n\nGaim Kibreab, a professor of refugee studies at London South Bank University, says Eritrea is the world\u2019s \u201cfastest emptying nation\u201d. About 400,000 people are estimated to have left the country in the past decade, from a population of just 5.1 million.\n\nThe UN and human rights activists estimate that as many as 5,000 Eritreans flee illegally every month, but the Eritrean government claims that the real number is closer to 1,000, because Ethiopians often pretend to be Eritrean when seeking asylum abroad.\n\n\n\nThose left behind in Asmara say everyone is well aware of what is happening. \u201cI know of thousands of people who have left,\u201d said Demsas, 49, as he strolled down one of the main streets. \u201cWe can feel it.\u201d\n\nThe government acknowledges that people are leaving in droves, but says it is part of an international conspiracy to weaken Eritrea. \u201cThe policy of the United States for the past 10 years has been to encourage the migration of Eritreans, especially Eritrean youth and especially Eritrean educated youth,\u201d said Yemane Gebreab, the director of political affairs for the ruling People\u2019s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) and a close advisor to Afwerki.\n\n\u201cIf they can encourage migration and especially desertion from the Eritrean army, which has been a main objective of this policy, then they will have achieved their aim of weakening Eritrea,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Last year, the government put a limit on the amount of money that people could withdraw from their bank accounts. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor law-abiding Eritreans, it is hard to avoid the national service programme. Hundreds of soldiers are known to storm neighbourhoods in Asmara every few months. Known as a giffa (raid), troops block off traffic and set up a cordon before going house to house in search of people who have not enlisted.\n\nYoung Eritreans say they feel trapped by these policies. If they are caught deserting, the government hands down brutal punishments. But if they stay, they are resigned to a life earning a monthly wage of 500 nakfa (\u00a325). \u201cAll of us are still in national service. We don\u2019t get enough [money] to live on,\u201d Henok said.\n\nThe government has recently changed some elements of national service, a sign that the regime may be aware of the damage its policies are causing. Those drafted in 2001 or earlier are being allowed to leave active service, but they are still required to work for the government. The maximum salary offered after demobilisation is 4,000 nakfa, equivalent to $165 on the black market, according to Hagos Ghebrehiwet, the PFDJ director of economic affairs.\n\nLast year, the government put a limit on the amount of money that people could withdraw from their bank accounts, saying it wanted to encourage citizens to use cheques and mobile money facilities. Hagos said: \u201cCash is the basis for illegal activities, like human trafficking.\u201d\n\nWe would all leave tomorrow if we had the money Adonay\n\nHowever, very few businesses accept cheques or credit cards, and since the introduction of the rule, the black market dollar exchange rate has halved, leading to speculation that the policy is a covert way to limit the number of people fleeing.\n\n\u201cWith this new currency, people don\u2019t have access to their money,\u201d Demsas said. According to human rights activist Meron Estefanos, wealthy Eritreans can pay high-ranking government officials between $5,000 and $6,000 to be smuggled out of the country and driven to Khartoum in Sudan. The fee for a similar journey across the border with Ethiopia is $2,000 to $3,000, she said.\n\nFor most Eritreans, who do not have rich friends or relatives overseas, the journey to Europe is extremely expensive. Natnael Haile, who lives in Sweden, says he was drafted into the army aged 13. After spending seven years repairing army cars on a desolate military base, he crept out of his dormitory in 2008. Haile paid smugglers $400 to take him to Sudan, where he was kidnapped and sold to nomads in the Sinai desert.\n\nHaile ended up paying a total of $7,100 to get on a boat heading for the Italian island of Lampedusa. But the account of his harrowing journey does not deter Adonay and his friends in Asmara. \u201cWe would all leave tomorrow if we had the money,\u201d they say.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in The Africa Report",

    "text": "Editor, 235 S. Nevada Ave., CS, CO 80903 \u2022 email: letters@csindy.com\n\nIf your comments are mailed or emailed to us, we'll consider them for publication \u2014 unless you request otherwise.\n\nPlease include your name, city of residence and a daytime phone number for verification.\n\nBattle for Nevada\n\nAt the second North Nevada Avenue Plan workshop, Travis Easton, city public works director, brought up converting North Nevada Avenue to a six-lane roadway and stated, \"We [city staff] see no utility for raised medians.\"\n\nWhen our family moved here, we considered a well-preserved Victorian on Colorado Avenue in Old Colorado City. We decided against it, realizing it was the last private home for several blocks.\n\nLooking at OCC today, it's easy to imagine how it looked 100 years ago. The thriving downtown, the warehouse/light industry district close to the rail line (now Interstate 25), with the tree-lined neighborhood of stately Victorians between. A simple zoning change allowed first-floor offices in the Victorians. Offices led to apartments; trees and lawns gave way to parking lots. Buildings with absentee owners went into decline, were torn down and replaced by gas stations, donut shops and more parking.\n\nMayor John Suthers has added city buses to Nevada Avenue traffic and proposes adding rail lines, requiring removal of the raised medians. Might a zoning overlay allowing first-floor offices be next? Remove trees, convert front and rear lawns to parking, add stairs to second-floor apartments and Suthers will achieve a solid line of businesses from Southgate to I-25, and another talking point in his race to the governor's mansion.\n\nYou may think, \"What do care? I don't live in the Old North End.\" Consider this: The Old North End has federally issued historic status and a very active neighborhood association. It has residents with political connections and the means to use them, and still Mayor Suthers' plan proceeds. If he can do this to the Old North End, think what he could do to your neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 Richard McKeown\n\nColorado Springs\n\nThe right choices\n\nIt seems like there is always some special observance around the corner. There is even a World Day for Farmed Animals. It's observed fittingly on Oct. 2 (Gandhi's birthday), intended to memorialize the billions of animals abused and killed for food around the world.\n\nMy first instinct was to dismiss it. But, I wanted to understand the impact of my diet and my food dollars on others.\n\nRecent undercover investigations showed male baby chicks suffocated in plastic garbage bags or ground to death, laying hens crowded into small wire cages, injured pigs killed by slamming their heads against the concrete floor, and cows skinned and dismembered while still conscious. As theologians debate whether there is life after death, I wondered whether these animals have a life before death and why I should subsidize these barbaric practices.\n\nI wonder no more, as I have now embraced a plant-based diet \u2014 green and yellow veggies, legumes, fruits, nuts, and some grains. Occasionally, I indulge in nut-based cheese or ice cream. Although motivated by compassion for animals, I have learned that my diet is also great for my health and for our planet.\n\n\u2014 Carl Silverman\n\nColorado Springs\n\nKey question\n\nI felt the Bern but now stand with Hillary. So, my fellow Coloradans who supported Bernie Sanders or even President Obama eight years ago, ask yourself: Do you really want Donald Trump anywhere near NORAD and/or the nuclear codes?\n\nIf the answer is \"yes,\" all I have to say to you is: \"Welcome President Putin, Kim Jong-un and the Trump regime.\"\n\nTo those who believe Trump will build a billion-dollar wall and Mexico will pay for it, I have a bridge to donate to you.\n\nVote, vote, vote.\n\n\u2014 Susan Tomblin\n\nColorado Springs\n\nReinventing ourselves\n\nI have written on these pages about the foolishness of describing our system of government as a democracy. One only needs to read the thoughts of our founders to disabuse themselves of such dangerous thinking. The Constitution itself guarantees us a Republican form of government. Think system here, not party.\n\nHillary Clinton represents neither a Republican nor Democratic form of government. I believe that she represents a totally new form of government that I refer to as Ineptocracy. It can best be defined as a system of government where the least capable to lead are elected by the least capable of producing, and where the members of society least likely to sustain themselves or succeed are rewarded with goods and services paid for by the confiscated wealth of a diminishing number of productive people.\n\nWe are divided by a force far more dangerous to liberty than things like ethnicity. We are increasingly divided between makers and takers, and the takers are winning. They represent a huge portion of the Clinton constituency.\n\nThis philosophy is incompatible with liberty, but in complete alliance with true socialism. Each one of us should evaluate what liberty means before election day.\n\n\u2014 Len Bentley\n\nColorado Springs\n\nOur own Donald\n\nThough Pam Zubeck knows (as do many others), for the general public the connection should be made explicitly between Pam's back-to-back news articles, \"How much is enough?\" (Sept. 14) and \"Partnering up\" (Sept. 21).\n\nDavid Jenkins is founder and chairman of Nor'wood Development Group. As Zubeck describes, the disregard for Utilities and ratepayers; the lawsuits and court petitions; the backroom wheeling and dealing in an unethical, for-profit arrangement with the governmental Pikes Peak Regional Building Dept. (which should be a serious conflict of interest); campaign donations to county and city leaders and others on the RBD commission; and the manipulations devised for realizing the City for Champions YUGE development scheme \u2014 all these testify, I think, to the uncontested bestowal of the moniker \"The Little Donald of Colorado Springs\" upon Mr. Jenkins.\n\nAnd he didn't even teach at Trump University (what a lost opportunity).\n\n\u2014 Marty Wolf\n\nColorado Springs\n\nElection issues\n\nWatching ads targeting amendments 69 and 70, I am reminded that in politics it is always educational to \"follow the money.\"\n\nWhat money is behind the anti-69 proposal? I expect it is the for-profit health care interests. It would be helpful if one could see the real cost to the average taxpayer and if the cost increase is offset by not having to pay for insurance.\n\nAmendment 70, raising the minimum wage, seems like a good idea but follow the money. Maybe we need a ballot issue requiring all political ads to list the sources of money paying for the air time.\n\n\u2014 Steve Snyder\n\nManitou Springs\n\nCount the ways\n\nHe slanders the president for five years, is forced to admit he was wrong, but doesn't apologize. Does he think he's Fonzie? I have news for Donald Trump, being able to say you're sorry is in the job description. You don't qualify. You don't have the knowledge, don't have the experience, don't have the temperament.\n\n\u2014 Gina Douglas\n\nColorado Springs",

    "text": "click to enlarge Rhonda Van Pelt\n\nConstant backups along Ruxton Avenue have made life miserable for residents.\n\nParking close to the Manitou Incline and Barr Trail will cost twice as much, following action last week by Manitou Springs City Council.\n\nCouncilors raised the rate at the Barr Trail Parking Lot to $20 per day and hiked the rate on Ruxton Avenue for nonresidents above the first block to $10 per hour.\n\nCouncilors also voted to double the fine for parking without a permit in the Residential Permit Parking areas from $35 to $70 for a first offense.\n\nIn a related action, Council expanded the Ruxton Avenue Residential Permit Parking area to include the 400 block of Ruxton and all of Winter Street.\n\nCouncil raised the parking fees and fines in the face of a recommendation from the Parking Authority Board that the rates not be increased and testimony by Incline users citing negative consequences.\n\nIn a memo to Council, the Parking Board stated that its members were considering a parking reservation system and signage to identify open parking spaces at the Barr Lot. In addition, the board will be budgeting in 2017 for a project to determine how previous fee increases affected Ruxton traffic.\n\nBoard members thought these programs might have more of an impact on traffic than raising fees.\n\n\"Study is warranted in order to make informed decisions and avoid the appearance of random decisions,\" the board's memo stated.\n\nThe board did recommend that the Ruxton Residential Permit Parking zone be expanded but unanimously agreed to oppose the fee increases at a work session.\n\nThe board \"requests discussions such as raising parking fees be vetted first through the PAB, which was created to advise Council on these matters,\" the memo stated.\n\nRuxton Avenue residents have been vocal about the noise, traffic, lack of parking and loss of quality of life they have experienced since use of the Incline was legalized three years ago.\n\nBut several Incline users told Council they did not think raising the fees and fines would solve these problems.\n\n\"We see the Incline as an asset and a huge economic driver,\" said Susan Davies, executive director of the Trails and Open Space Coalition. \"If we make it so prohibitive for people to use the Incline and pay those high fees, I think it would be a real travesty, given the effort that's been put in. Please keep it the public asset and the treasure that we have.\"\n\nIncline user Michael Everson said parking near the Incline has become more scarce and expensive in the past three years. He termed the fee increases \"excessive.\"\n\n\"It's unfair to people that are just coming to visit,\" Everson said. \"I use the Incline a lot and I would like to see it be more accessible.\"\n\nSandi Yukman, who said she represented many Incline enthusiasts, asked that Council consider gathering input from stakeholders including residents, business owners, land owners, users and the city of Colorado Springs.\n\n\"I am simply asking you to reconsider a more robust process before making changes,\" Yukman said.\n\n\"I find it interesting that with the Incline being closed for a month that community angst is down and nonresident angst is up,\" Councilor Randy Hodges said \"What we're trying to do is protect our residents, who have been very vocal about the problems.\n\n\"What we're proposing to do is to encourage people to park in the parking lot we paid $650,000 for and ride the shuttle.\"\n\nHodges added that he did not think the fee increases would resolve all of the problems, \"but it's one more step to encourage people to use what we've put in place and try to get a little relief for our residents.\"\n\nMayor Nicole Nicoletta noted that Council has had many discussions about issues related to the Incline and the Cog Railway.\n\n\"I have heard from a resident who's concerned that first responders can't get to his house in time,\" Nicoletta said. \"One hundred percent, our first priorities are Manitou Springs residents and public safety.\"\n\nCouncilor Bob Todd agreed that \"we do have to incrementally move forward\" but said, \"We need to support the citizens advisory boards.\"\n\nCouncil voted 5-2 to approve Nicoletta's motion to implement the fee and fine increases, with Todd and Councilor Becky Elder dissenting.\n\nThere is a break for hikers using the Barr Trail. The new fee schedule specifies that $15 of the $20 parking fee for the Barr Trail lot is refundable upon validation at Barr Camp.\n\nParking in the Ruxton Residential Parking area is open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. It is reserved for residential permit holders during other hours and on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe fees for second and third offenses of unpermitted parking were raised to $100 for a second offense and $150 for a third offense in a 12-month period.\n\nThe Incline currently is closed to the public while repairs, which began in late August, continue until December.\n\nThis story first appeared in the Pikes Peak Bulletin.",

    "text": "click to enlarge JrCasas /Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to getting initiatives passed by voters, money counts. Some campaigns have a lot more of it than others.\n\nIf you think Amendment 69, otherwise known as ColoradoCare, is a bad idea, you're in good company.\n\nA recent Colorado Mesa University-Rocky Mountain PBS poll of 540 Colorado voters found that 56 percent oppose the plan to provide universal health care for state residents.\n\nSome might say that's because people like their health insurance plans, fear the effects of a big tax increase, or are skeptical that the plan could pay for itself (\"Visualize universal coverage,\" News, Aug. 17).\n\nOf course, there is another explanation: Big business and interest groups have pumped untold millions into Amendment 69 opposition campaigns ahead of the November election.\n\nIn politics, money talks. And this election season, as voters face down seven citizen-driven statewide initiatives \u2014 many of them deeply controversial \u2014 some campaigns have more funding than others. That certainly rings true when it comes to what are arguably the state's most progressive proposals: Amendment 69 and Amendment 70 (which would raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020).\n\nColoradans for Coloradans, the most well-known anti-69 campaign, had raised $3.97 million as of Sept. 14, according to Colorado Secretary of State filings. A second anti-69 campaign, Colorado Health Care Choices, had $475,519.31 in contributions, all of it from the Colorado Health Care Institute, a recently established 501(c)4 that doesn't have to reveal its donors. (It is not associated with the similarly named Colorado Health Institute, which has released studies on Amendment 69.)\n\nMeanwhile, an Americans for Prosperity representative says the Koch brothers-backed group is running its own \"six-figure\" campaign against Amendment 69, though it doesn't have to reveal its finances under the law.\n\nIn contrast, ColoradoCareYes, the pro-Amendment 69 group, has raised just $745,690.86 since its founding in 2015. In 2016, it's raised $321,706.37. That hasn't been enough to pay for the TV commercials that anti groups have funded.\n\nAmendment 70, on the flip side, appears to be the Goliath in its race. The same poll that shows Amendment 69 losing, has Amendment 70 winning with 58 percent support.\n\nBacked by labor union dollars, Colorado Families for a Fair Wage had brought in $2.3 million by Sept. 14 compared to the opposition campaign, Keep Colorado Working, which had raised $636,884.99 in that time period, Secretary of State's Office documents reveal.\n\nHowever, things may be looking up for Keep Colorado Working, which just purchased \u2014 or as their spokesperson puts it \"reserved\" \u2014 $2.3 million in TV ads.\n\nSean Duffy, spokesperson for Coloradans for Coloradans, says he's not ashamed of where his campaign's money is coming from.\n\n\"Of course the business community's very concerned about Amendment 69,\" he says. \"And, in addition, companies that operate now in health care, health insurance, understand the real threat that this very poorly crafted amendment presents to the quality of health care.\"\n\nColoradoCare, which would create a Medicaid-like health insurance system that would cover all Coloradans through a 10 percent tax, has been divisive, drawing opposition from many business groups, health insurance groups, medical facilities and associations, as well as a large group of powerful politicians, including many of the state's top Democrats.\n\nOn the other hand, ColoradoCare also has some important allies, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Gloria Steinem and Noam Chomsky. What ColoradoCare doesn't have, however, is the big donors the anti groups have.\n\nSome major funders of the Coloradans for Coloradans campaign include health insurer Anthem, Inc. ($1 million); health insurer Kaiser Permanente Financial Services Ops ($500,000); health insurer United Healthcare Services Inc. ($450,000); Denver hospital system HealthONE System Support ($250,000); health care provider Centura Health ($125,000); the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce ($100,000); Colorado Association of Realtors ($100,000); insurance brokerage firm Mountain West Series of Lockton Companies, LLC ($100,000); Cigna Health and Life Insurance ($100,000); Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ($100,000); and the health care organization and hospital family SCL Health ($100,000).\n\nDuffy notes that 56 percent of his campaign's donations are under $100, and says the campaign isn't just doing an expensive ad blitz; it's been going for months to community meetings, from Rotary Clubs to HOAs, and debating representatives from the opposing campaign.\n\n\"It's been a very energetic campaign, and we've got I think 1,100 groups and individuals have signed on to oppose Amendment 69,\" he says, noting that the Colorado Medical Society, which opposes 69, found that 78 percent of physicians who responded to their query also opposed the measure.\n\nBut here's the twist: From a fundraising standpoint, Amendment 69 appears more popular with individuals than the anti campaigns. In 2016 alone, ColoradoCareYes had 3,620 donors, more than 99 percent individual people.\n\nTo put that in perspective, that's more than 10 times the donors that Coloradans for Coloradans has. (Coloradans for Coloradans, by the way, lists about 275 individual people who have donated to its campaign in its filings.)\n\nOwen Perkins, spokesperson for ColoradoCareYes, says the opposition is anything but grassroots, calling their contributions \"a who's who list of big medicine and big pharma.\" Perkins says he thinks big insurers could probably handle losing Coloradans as customers, but he believes that they are fighting 69 because the system would be effective, and within a few years, it would be duplicated in other states before becoming a nationwide system.\n\n\"If you can buy an election, they're well on their way,\" he says. \"But we're certainly hoping that Coloradans will do as they've done in the past and be able to make decisions regardless of advertising.\"\n\nNotably, the biggest contributors to ColoradoCareYes are individuals, and only two have given more than $100,000. No donor has yet reached $200,000 in donations.\n\nPerkins says many volunteers have been knocking on doors and manning phone banks, and he's hoping the Sanders group Our Revolution may boost the campaign by making calls on ColoradoCare's behalf.\n\nPatty Kupfer, campaign manager for Colorado Families for a Fair Wage, which is supporting Amendment 70, says it may look like her campaign is on the path to victory, but she's cautious.\n\n\"I think that we feel like we're in a fairly strong position, however the hardest part is when you're the 'yes' campaign you have to get on the ballot first and that cost us almost a million dollars,\" she says.\n\nKupfer adds that the opposition campaign, Keep Colorado Working, appears to have recently received a large donation that it will not need to disclose for weeks. She notes the anti-70 campaign, which has reported raising less than $1 million, recently purchased $2.3 million in TV ads.\n\nKupfer suspects that one of two major funders is footing the bill: The National Restaurant Association (the Hospitality Issue PAC, funded by the National Restaurant Association, has given $200,000 to the anti campaign so far) or the Workforce Fairness Institute, an organization that insists on its website that it's not anti-union, which has contributed $250,000 to the anti campaign.\n\nTyler Sandberg, campaign manager for Keep Colorado Working, says none of that is true. He says he simply \"reserved\" the ads, in hopes of raising enough to cover the costs.\n\nKupfer says she isn't buying it.\n\n\"That's 100 percent not true,\" she says. \"You can not reserve one minute without paying for it.\"\n\n(The Indy checked with Nick Matesi, general manager of KKTV Channel 11, for insight on the argument. In a way, he says, both campaigns are right. TV stations often allow campaigns to \"pre-book\" time, he says, but won't run a campaign ad until they have a check. KKTV also has a two-week cancellation policy. Generally, he says, campaigns don't book time unless they expect to have the money to pay for it.)\n\nBut Sandberg has some bombs of his own to lob. He says he isn't getting big funding because the wage increase wouldn't hurt big businesses; it would hurt tiny ones. (The only other major funder of the anti campaign so far is Colorado Citizens Protecting Our Constitution, a nonprofit group that previously targeted lawmakers who voted for gun control. It's given $75,000.)\n\n\"We're up against bottomless pits of big labor union money,\" Sandberg says.\n\nColorado Families for a Fair Wage does have a number of major funders, including: the Civic Participation Action Fund ($500,000), a 501(c)(4) that does not have to reveal its donors, which gives to organizations and projects that \"promote racial equality, expand civic engagement and increase economic opportunity for low income communities and communities of color\"; the Center for Popular Democracy Action Fund ($350,000), another 501(c)(4) with a \"pro-worker, pro-immigrant, racial and economic justice agenda\"; the Fairness Project ($336,132.07), a labor union-backed fund aiming to raise the minimum wage in states across the nation; the Service Employees International Union ($250,000); the National Education Association, or teachers union, ($250,000); the Sixteen Thirty Fund ($114,500), another progressive 501(c)(4); and the New Venture Fund ($110,781.32), a 501(c)(3) which focuses its energy on \"conservation, global health, public policy, international development, education, disaster recovery, and the arts.\"\n\nSandberg says his campaign, on the other hand, is supported by small businesses that can't afford to give their employees a big raise and stay in business \u2014 particularly if they're located in a rural area. He says Amendment 70 would have gotten more support from businesses if it had allowed for a different rate of wage increases for small businesses and rural areas.\n\n\"Everyone deserves to make a living wage,\" he says, \"but it's what the businesses can afford.\"\n\nBut Kupfer says that people across the state need a raise \u2014 and she thinks claiming that businesses will go broke is a scare tactic. After all, she points out, Colorado added thousands of jobs in the two years following its last bump in the minimum wage, in 2006.\n\n\"I find it pretty cynical,\" she says, \"that they are willing to spend millions and millions of dollars to keep from giving Coloradans a raise.\"",

If your policy only has limited cover, it is possible to take out a Household Goods in Transit policy, which will ensure you are covered for the move. \u201cThis is a separate policy and would only cover your goods for the period of transit,\u201d Visser says.\n\nAnother option would be taking out insurance via the moving company you are using, but this can end up being a more costly choice. \u201cIt would be best to weigh up your options and choose the one best suited to your pocket.\u201d\n\nUsing your own vehicle or a friend\u2019s bakkie\n\nMany of us rope in help from family and friends to save on moving costs. This is a safe option when it comes to using your insurance, but only in the event of an accident.\n\n\u201cYour insurance cover will only be valid for collision or overturning of the vehicle, but it will not cover you if any of your goods are stolen in transit,\u201d Visser says. \u201cAn example here could be if your friend stops at the shop in between picking up your goods and dropping them off, and a chancer steals something out of the vehicle,\u201d Visser says.\n\nWith a smaller vehicle, there may be a few trips required to transport all your goods to your new home. \u201cYour insurer won\u2019t restrict you as to how many of your goods will be covered per load in transit, however, you must make sure that your policy covers you for the total sum insured for all the goods you are moving. This means your contents insurance must be at the correct value to replace all your goods, should anything go wrong.\u201d\n\nGoods in your new home vs. your old home\n\nIf you are moving in stages, there will be a time when some of your goods are in your new home and some of your goods are still in your old home. Both properties will need to be included in your policy to cover your contents on both premises for the moving period.",

    "text": "click to enlarge Nat Stein\n\nCouncil wants more information.\n\nAt its Monday work session, Colorado Springs City Council displayed a rare show of restraint in regulating the marijuana industry. Rather than advancing ordinances establishing a licensing board or carving out hardship exemptions for certain marijuana businesses for a first reading, councilors asked for more information and time.\n\nThe recommendations in question came from the Special Marijuana Working Group, a body of various stakeholders that formed out of the new moratorium enacted in May. The group had to address a gap left open by the city's latest policy changes: that council changed where certain marijuana businesses are allowed to be while also preventing them from actually locating there.\n\nSpecifically, council rezoned cultivation facilities (OPCs) to a use-by-right in industrial zones and a conditional use in certain commercial zones, created a licensing split for infused product manufacturers (MMIPs) into hazardous (only permitted in industrial zones) and non-hazardous (conditionally permitted in commercial zones), and increased the mandatory buffer between marijuana businesses and schools, child-care centers and drug rehab facilities. But at the same time, the task force convinced Council to put a new moratorium in place, preventing the city licensing office from accepting any applications, even from existing licensees.\n\nSo that's the \"hardship\" the working group means to address: the category of licensed businesses that either want to expand in their current location or move to a legally conforming one. Several councilors, including Don Knight and Andy Pico, wanted to know how many businesses fall into that category before deciding whether to create an exemption for them. City staff didn't have an answer, and no industry representatives were present, but Councilor Larry Bagley estimated three or four.\n\nA representative from the Regional Business Alliance advocated for holding off on the exemptions. \"There's not one clear message about what the economic impacts are,\" she told Council, \"but what we don't want is to say OK, hardship exemption, then move someone into a conforming zone only to find out in May 2017 that it's not conforming again.\"\n\nThe issue there is that the working group offered some inklings but no definitive conclusions about zoning recommendations for Economic Opportunity Zones (EOZs) or Urban Renewal Authority areas (URAs). Councilor Jill Gaebler urged city staff not to delay on answering those questions, as did Tom Strand, saying \"the moratorium is itself a hardship.\" He reminded his colleagues to treat dispensaries like the legitimate businesses they are and to \"show some humanity\" for the patients they serve.\n\nBridget Seritt of Impact Alliance, a new coalition of patient advocacy groups, put a finer point on it: \"Patients already lost the ability to grow and provide for themselves, and if we clamp down on this industry even more we'll be reducing access to medicine even more by badly inflating the cost of the product.\"\n\nShe further reminded Council to \"be mindful of who exactly we are trying to help here. ... This law (Amendment 20) was passed to save lives, not to proliferate big business.\"\n\nCouncil unanimously decided against creating a marijuana licensing board akin to the alcohol board, and split 4-4 on the hardship exemption issue because Councilor Bill Murray was absent. It will come up again in two weeks at the Oct. 10 work session. Deputy Chief of Staff Bret Waters advised Council that the working group next intends to bring forward a proposal to cap or otherwise limit marijuana business licensing in the city.\n\nMMJ for PTSD advances\n\nColorado has taken a small but significant step closer to joining 18 other states that consider Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder a qualifying condition for medical marijuana. A panel of five lawmakers unanimously recommended the Legislature add PTSD to the debilitating health conditions outlined by the 16-year-old constitutional amendment that's the backbone of Colorado's medical marijuana system.\n\nThe policy change has been rejected four times by the state health board under the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. PTSD patients (mostly combat veterans) sued the state arguing the decision was \"arbitrary and capricious\" given the impediments to conducting the kind of research board members see as necessary.\n\nA major clinical trial on treating PTSD with medical marijuana is now underway after years of bureaucratic resistance. The biggest stumbling block for that study, which was awarded $2 million by the state health board, dissolved recently when the Drug Enforcement Agency expanded sourcing opportunities for scientists. Studies like that of Dr. Sue Sisley can source the cannabis they need from approved in-state growers.\n\nBut real victory will have to wait until the outcome of the lawsuit against the state health board or a vote in the Legislature in 2017.",

    "text": "Casualties of war paint\n\nI dragged my boyfriend into the makeup store Sephora, and he said, \"Save your money! You don't need any of this stuff. I like you better without makeup.\" Huh? Why is there a huge makeup industry when so many men say they don't even like makeup? \u2014 Pretty Confused\n\nA friend of mine, bioethicist Alice Dreger, tweeted, \"True story: I was on Oprah for a show about how appearance doesn't matter and there was a whole guy tasked with doing just her eyelashes.\"\n\nA lot of us are in some denial about makeup. And sure, there are men who really do like women better without a drop of the stuff. And then there are those who just think they do \u2014 like the men on Reddit who posted all of these supposed \"no makeup!\" photos of female celebs. I particularly loved one of Jenna Jameson that a guy captioned \"before all the surgeries and without makeup.\" Meanwhile, tiny type below the photo lists the makeup and hair goo she actually has on. My other favorite was one of Rihanna, who also very clearly was not sans maquillage.\n\nGuys, sorry, but cat-eye liquid eyeliner does not appear naturally on the female eye in the wild.\n\nBiological anthropologist Douglas Jones finds that men are attracted to women with somewhat \"neotenous\" features \u2014 meaning somewhat babylike ones like big eyes, full lips, a small jaw and chin and clear skin \u2014 which correlate with health and fertility. So, basically, what we call \"beauty\" is evolution's version of a street-corner sign spinner: \"Genes passed on here!!! Best babies in town!!!\"\n\nIn other words, makeup is fake-up \u2014 a woman's way of making herself out to have more neotenous features and thus a higher mate value than she actually does. (The male version of this is leasing a top-of-the-line Tesla while living in a tent in Grandma's backyard.)\n\nSo, a man will think he has an aversion to makeup, but it's really an aversion to being deceived by it. This doesn't mean you have to stop wearing it. Just keep in mind that \u2014 except for special occasions and those special dudes who are into your looking like your office is a pole \u2014 men generally prefer the \"natural look.\"\n\nOf course, the reality is, this sort of \"natural\" is about an hour and a dozen products away from being \"au naturel.\" What ultimately matters is that you don't look so dramatically different in makeup that when your boyfriend bumps into the barefaced you at the fridge in the wee hours, he puts his hands up and yells, \"Take whatever you want; just let me live!\"\n\nBuddy surfing\n\nThis guy and I have been friends with benefits for six months. We were casual friends for two years prior to hooking up, but we have gotten much closer since. So, can FWB things ever turn into real relationships, or did we blow our chance? \u2014 Hoping\n\nFriends-with-benefits arrangements are, to some degree, replacing dating. Unfortunately, trying to turn an FWB thing into a relationship can be like trying to return a shirt. One you've worn. For a while. You march straight up to the counter and lay the thing out. The guy at the register frowns: \"Ma'am, Macy's closed six years ago. This is Chipotle now.\"\n\nIt's helpful to understand what anthropologist Helen Fisher and her colleagues have discovered \u2014 that lust, love and attachment aren't just emotions; they are motivational systems (ultimately for the purpose of reproduction and child rearing). Lust eventually wanes (which makes sense, because \"Ohhh, baby\" needs to give way to feeding the baby). The neurochemistry behind lust \"can trigger expressions of attachment,\" Fisher explains. However, in men, high testosterone \u2014 in general or from having sex \u2014 \"can reduce attachment.\" This is probably more likely if a man has a \"high baseline level of testosterone,\" which is typically reflected in a strong jaw and chin, a muscular body and dominant behavior.\n\nBecause you two were friends first and seem to care about each other, maybe you can be more than sex friends. Tell him you really enjoy hanging with him, and ask whether he'd be up for more than FWB. But take the low-pressure approach: You don't want an answer on the spot; you'd just like him to think about it. This should make you seem less desperate and possibly let him feel like having more was his idea.\n\nIf he wants less, you should probably stop seeing him \u2014 at least naked \u2014 for a while. He may end up missing you, which could energize his interest in you in a way FWB tends not to do. (They call it \"the thrill of the chase,\" not the thrill of \"you can text any day at 2 a.m. and she'll let you come over.\")\n\nGot a problem?

    "text": "click to enlarge Nat Stein\n\nGot toxic water? You could be entitled to damages.\n\nIt was only a matter of time.\n\nSeveral avenues for legal recourse are now available to residents in the Fountain, Security, Widefield area who learned earlier this year that toxic chemicals have been seeping into their drinking water for decades. Three class-action lawsuits were filed in the past week \u2014 two by Denver-based Hannon Law Firm and one by Springs-based McDivitt Law Firm in partnership with New York-based Napoli Shkolnik PLLC \u2014 against a half dozen chemical manufacturers.\n\nThey share a central allegation: The companies \"knew or should have known\" about the danger their products posed to the environment, human health and private property, and were therefore wrong to keep making, distributing and profiting off them for decades.\n\nThis issue trickled into public awareness in January when routine but unrequired testing found concerning levels of perfluoroalkyls \u2014 or PFAs, which belong to the broader category, perfluorinated chemicals, or PFCs \u2014 in 94 public water systems nationwide, including three that serve 70,000 customers locally.\n\nThe actual amounts weren't enough to mandate action, but they were enough to raise flags among a community of researchers, public health experts and watchdogs who have long argued that the federal government's regulatory standards for these man-made, industrial chemicals are far too lenient given their documented links to cancer, liver damage and low birth weights.\n\nThose January results put more pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency to act, so in May came a new provisional health advisory that lowered the level of PFCs considered potentially hazardous to 70 parts per trillion down from 400 ppt for PFOA and 200 ppt for PFOS. The action was not regulatory or enforceable, but did catalyze movement that's beginning to gain steam.\n\nLocally, the contamination is likely coming from Peterson Air Force Base, where personnel have used a fire suppressant called Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) to extinguish petroleum-based flames in both emergency and training situations. AFFF was originally developed in the 1960s through a partnership between the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and 3M chemical company. Since then, other manufacturers have come up with their own formulations, used by military and municipal firefighters nationwide to save lives.\n\nBut, because it's full of PFCs, AFFF may also threaten lives. That's why its manufacturers now stand accused.\n\nThe Hannon complaints name 3M, Ansul and National Foam as defendants. The McDivitt/Napoli Shkolnik complaint does too, adding Angus Fire, Buckeye Fire Protection Co. and Chemguard.\n\nPeterson AFB spokeswoman Shellie-Anne Espinosa tells the Indy that the base currently has 2,404 gallons in stock, still authorized for emergency use, nearly half purchased from Ansul in 2013-2014. Bases across the country will replace the foam with a more environmentally friendly alternative by the end of the year.\n\nInvestigative findings released by the Air Force Civil Engineer Center in August revealed several accidental discharges of AFFF at Peterson over the years (including one in which personnel tripped the manual release while playing basketball). But otherwise, the foam was used according to the manufacturers' instructions.\n\nAnd that, plaintiffs argue, is exactly what went wrong. The chemical companies developed and sold a defective product without adequate warning about its dangers. Not only that, the suits allege, but the companies did so knowingly and recklessly.\n\nBoth law firms offer the same evidence (though more is likely to surface during discovery). First, 3M started monitoring its own employees' health in the mid-1980s and determined the fluorochemicals did indeed bioaccumulate in their bodies. Also, an EPA internal memo in 2000 about 3M's voluntary phaseout of PFOA and PFOS stated that \"3M data supplied to EPA indicated that these chemicals are very persistent in the environment, have a strong tendency to accumulate in human and animal tissues and could potentially pose a risk to human health and the environment over the long term.\"\n\nIn 2000, 3M took those products off the market but didn't issue a recall while other manufacturers continued to produce PFC-laden AFFF. In 2010, EPA launched a stewardship program \"inviting\" major chemical companies to cease production. Other than 3M, none of the named defendants agreed to participate.\n\n3M's attorney William A. Brewer III expressed confidence about his defense, saying by email, \"We believe these legal actions against 3M in connection with AFFF lack merit, and fail to appreciate that 3M sold these products with instructions regarding their safe use and disposal,\" adding that \"3M acted responsibly at all times.\"\n\nThe other defendants either ignored or declined the Indy's request for comment.\n\nThough the lawsuits are similar in essence, there are subtle differences. Both list shared grounds for legal action \u2014 negligence, defective product design, failure to warn about that defective product design and unjust enrichment from the whole enterprise \u2014 but McDivitt includes nuisance, i.e., that the defendants' actions caused plaintiffs \"inconvenience or annoyance\" and \"unreasonably interfered with the use and enjoyment of their property.\"\n\nBoth suits want the chemical companies to pay for personal injury and property damage, including costs of medical monitoring for those who drank the contaminated water, compensation for loss of property value and surrender of profits made off the wrongdoing.\n\nThe Hannon complaints identify the injured parties as residing in a particular geographic area bounded by the southern edge of the Fountain Water District on the north, Interstate 25 on the west, the southernmost point of Hanover Road on the south and the eastern boundary of Widefield Water District extended to Hanover Road to the east. Anyone who lives in that region and consumed municipally supplied water could be considered a member of that class action.\n\nMcDivitt sets forth multiple, overlapping classes: Fountain Creek Watershed Area residents who drink from the municipal water supply; residents of that same area who drink from private wells; and all area property owners.\n\nKevin Hannon, the Denver attorney whose firm has waged class-actions against big-name energy, insurance and car companies, chose not to comment, but Mike McDivitt, of the local personal injury firm, did go on record to say his and Hannon's firms are cooperating, not competing.\n\n\"The fact that there's more than one lawsuit just indicates the severity of the problem,\" McDivitt says. He expects the suits to be consolidated eventually because \"at the end of the day, we're all on the same side\" and indicated it's not out of the question for the litigation to eventually connect with others nationwide. (Around 5.2 million Americans drink water that contains more PFCs than is advised, according to a New York Times estimate.)\n\nPrivate tort remedies of the sort now pursued seem to be all that's available to local residents given that PFCs are still unregulated. Congress recently overhauled the decades-old Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the primary federal statute relevant to manmade toxins, but environmental advocates remain cynical that the reforms really have much teeth.\n\nD.C.-based National Resource Defense Council's Public Health Director Erik Olson offers why lobbying for tougher protections of Americans' drinking water has been an uphill battle: Regulating chemicals already on the market is a \"complex and burdensome\" administrative process that the EPA doesn't have \"the stomach\" to take on.\n\nEPA officials didn't reply to the Indy's request for comment by deadline, but PFCs have been designated a \"contaminant of concern.\"\n\nThe reformed law's risk evaluation process now includes the opportunity to consider health effects specific to vulnerable populations (in the case of PFCs, newborns and the elderly). But Olson feels these improvements are more nominal than substantive. \"Most people don't realize,\" he said, \"that the entire regulatory system for toxic chemicals relies on studies done by the industry itself. And that's a really huge problem.\"\n\nFor the time being, local residents who think they may qualify as class members can contact the firms heading the litigation to learn about their options.\n\nMcDivitt believes \"it would really be to your disadvantage to sit back and do nothing.\"",

    "text": "click to enlarge Griffin Swartzell\n\nOn Saturday, Sept. 3, Ladyfingers Letterpress co-founders Morgan Calderini and Arley-Rose Torsone released a new greeting card, sending out the image on Facebook and Instagram. The card is an homage to the breakout Netflix hit Stranger Things. It depicts an iconic scene from the series, simply drawn, with the text: \"On a scale from one to ten... you're an Eleven.\" Torsone's hand-drawn pressed lettering even pays homage to ITC Benguiat, the font used in the show's iconic title.\n\n\"It went viral over the weekend,\" says Calderini. \"We sold a thousand cards in one weekend \u2014 to individuals. People ordering like one card at a time.\"\n\nIn the weeks since, the card has been an overwhelming success, pushing Calderini and Torsone to print more and more.\n\n\"We have the means to just have an idea, make it, share it, then sell it,\" says Torsone.\n\n\"I think being here and having our company be the size it is now \u2014 it's just the two of us \u2014 we're able to be really nimble and respond to that stuff,\" Calderini says. \"It's exciting to make something that many people are excited about.\"\n\nLadyfingers Letterpress formed in 2011. Torsone and Calderini were getting married and, being designers, they made their own poster-sized wedding invitations. Torsone hand-lettered the text, which they pressed in neon inks, a mashup of classic design elements with a striking modern aesthetic. They posted their designs on Flickr, and the papercraft blog Oh So Beautiful Paper picked up on their work. The resulting flood of emails and calls requesting similarly striking custom wedding invites turned into a full-blown business. To this day, every invitation package they make is one-of-a-kind. Their work has netted them a swath of the Greeting Card Association's Louie awards, including a four-year winning streak for Print and Production Excellence.\n\n\"[It's] a lot of intensive labor to get into the design and also intensive labor to get into the production of it,\" says Torsone. They print and produce on presses from the early 20th century, including one press from 1904 which they brought from their original Rhode Island location.\n\nIn 2013, they expanded into wholesale greeting cards, which they sell from their 113 E. Bijou St. storefront as well as online and in shops around the world.\n\nTorsone's sense of humor leads in most of the cards. She pens cards celebrating \"significant otters,\" lampooning smartphone foibles, cursing Mercury's retrograde and reassuring a friend going through gender transition. They write for more audiences than many greeting card companies. One great example reads, \"Congratulations on your bun in the freezer,\" depicting a test tube greeting new parents, for all families that need a helping hand from biomedical technology to grow.\n\nclick to enlarge Griffin Swartzell\n\nNo surprise, both had a defiant streak when they were first learning their trades in college, as well as a taste for pre-digital techniques. Torsone says she's always been a compulsive drawer. When she found her design education veering towards digital production, she did as much as she could with traditional materials. Calderini, meanwhile, finished her printmaking degree with a massive silkscreening project \u2014 an entire hot-air balloon. While she didn't get to the screening, she was able to accomplish the first few steps: making and selling enough prints and silk-screened goods to buy and learn to fly a hot-air balloon.\n\n\"If you think about printmaking in its truest form,\" says Torsone, \"it's the replication of a message. The whole renaissance and the age of information happened because Gutenberg invented this press that could create information and spread it widely and cheaply.\"\n\nToday, as well as selling and producing cards and wedding invitations, they also teach classes on printmaking and letterpressing, from California to Miami to Iceland, with a special focus on Colorado Springs and Denver. Calderini notes that classes sell out a few months in advance.\n\n\"We're starting to think about what that next batch [of classes] looks like, because the response has been so great,\" she says.\n\n\"It goes back to the days of having the community print shop, when we were teaching people how to print and make things,\" says Torsone. \"If you can teach someone how to print their message, if you can give them the ability to mass-produce something they want to share with the world, it's so empowering. We believe in the power of print, we believe in the power of the people, and we're excited to provide that resource here in Colorado Springs.\"",

    "title": "Facebook and Google: most powerful and secretive empires we've ever known",
    "text": "Google and Facebook have conveyed nearly all of us to this page, and just about every other idea or expression we\u2019ll encounter today. Yet we don\u2019t know how to talk about these companies, nor digest their sheer power.\n\n\n\nWe call them platforms, networks or gatekeepers. But these labels hardly fit. The appropriate metaphor eludes us; even if we describe them as vast empires, they are unlike any we\u2019ve ever known. Far from being discrete points of departure, merely supporting the action or minding the gates, they have become something much more significant. They have become the medium through which we experience and understand the world.\n\nAs their users, we are like the blinkered young fish in the parable memorably retold by David Foster Wallace. When asked \u201cHow\u2019s the water?\u201d we swipe blank: \u201cWhat the hell is water?\u201d\n\nWe pay attention, sometimes, to racism, death threats, outrage. Other than that, we have barely started feeling their algorithmic undertow. We have trouble grasping the scope of it: the vast server farms, the job cuts, the barriers to entry, the public-private partnerships, the manufacturing of data, the knowing cities, the branded self, the slavish service to their metrics, the monoculture.\n\nHow technology disrupted the truth | Katharine Viner Read more\n\nGoogle is not an \u201cengine\u201d that simply drives us to an objectively correct destination and then sits inert, like one of the cars that it seeks to replace with its new ride-sharing service.\n\nFacebook is not merely a \u201cnetwork\u201d for connection, like the old phone network or electrical grid, as if it had no agency, and did not take a piece of every last interaction (or false start) between friends. When and how much we interact, we rely on Facebook to say. These are not mere \u201cedge providers\u201d, peripheral to infrastructure, or mere \u201capplications\u201d that we can select or refuse.\n\nEmily Bell, founding director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, offered up a more active image: \u201cFacebook is eating the world\u201d. She was concerned with the silos of power controlling how news is published and distributed. But the image she conjured of a ravenous engine of consumption suggested something more than mere media concentration.\n\nCharacterizing Facebook or Google as powerful media organs \u2013 even the most powerful \u2013 actually understates their power. Marshall McLuhan, 60 years ago, gave us another, fuller understanding of media. Electric light is a medium \u201ctotally radical, pervasive, and decentralized\u201d that appears to us as media only when constituted into video content. Electrical current itself completely changes our relationship to the world and, in the process, reconstitutes us. A medium is not merely something that feeds us content. It is a condition like air or water, through which we move without noticing.\n\nFacebook and Google are not only carrying us, but constituting us. We are, in fact, their media.\n\nThe analogy captures part of what is happening, but goes even further. Facebook and Google are not only carrying us, but constituting us. We are, in fact, their media. Geared as they are to sharing, clicking and eyeballs, these media do not measure and do not value solitary contemplation, reflection and disconnection. They thrive and pulse on popularity, not veracity. They feed on extremes, not common causes.\n\nSummer 2016 was riddled with anxiety about the power of social media to propel public discourse and mob opinion in dangerous directions, and the failure of traditional media to check it.\n\nThe echo chamber of social media magnified the appeal of Trump and Brexit to the casualties of globalization and free trade. What remained of the traditional media lacked the interest \u2013 because truth-telling is expensive and boring \u2013 or wherewithal \u2013 because they have no money, and fading influence \u2013 to effectively call out the lies spreading like algae over the warming western world. Sometimes the old papers came through with quality reporting, but mere facts are rarely sufficient to survive the torrent of the digital slipstream.\n\nThere is the ongoing conflict over these companies\u2019 self-identification as mere \u201ctechnology\u201d businesses, and the media critics\u2019 charge that they are \u201cmedia companies\u201d. The issue being debated is usually whether Facebook or Google produce content or make editorial decisions, and in that sense constitute media. It\u2019s hardly worth debating: of course they produce content, if only by algorithmically selecting, prioritizing and presenting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook and Google are not only carrying us, but constituting us. Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Facebook is so much more than a media company. Traditional media companies sell advertising \u201creal estate\u201d and independent entities like Nielsen or the Alliance for Audited Media assess the value. Facebook plays both sides: it offers real estate (video advertising) and provides the assessments (viewership data). Not surprisingly, Facebook makes mistakes. There is no auditing, no independence; we simply take Facebook\u2019s word for it, when and how much the errors occur. Like Poseidon, FB blows, the currents move, and content producers and advertisers are swept in new directions.\n\nPublic opinion seems to vacillate between valorizing and excoriating the digital empires. The empire is seen as bad when it interrupts the supposed neutrality of content with human hacks such as Facebook news modifications and trending topics curation (the latter now fully automated, Facebook claims). And it is seen as good when Facebook intervenes in supposedly responsible causes like Google\u2019s elimination of payday loan ads or Facebook\u2019s promotion of voting.\n\n'Facebook needs an editor': media experts urge change after photo dispute Read more\n\nOr is it? We\u2019re not sure. Because some experts think payday loans are not the real problem \u2013 it\u2019s low wages \u2013 and Facebook\u2019s promotion of democratic participation may be selective and skewed. If Facebook is good when it livecasts police shootings to hold government to account, is it also good when it partners with government to prevent terrorism? We assess the benevolence of empire on a case-by-case basis, influenced by normative commitments and superficial detail. What we don\u2019t do is exercise some control or even suasion over the power these companies have to do anything and everything.\n\nWe enjoy the bounty of their empire. Free services, easy communication. The ever-expanding convenience of commerce.\n\nWe leave it to the media companies to worry about the empire\u2019s tribute for this bounty: most of the advertising dollars that once went to support journalism, leaving the papers vassal to their feudal protectors.\n\nThe metaphors that we use \u2013 empire, medium, undertow \u2013 allude to the power of the all-knowing digital companies. Speaking clearly about this power and its effects is critical. Ultimately, the public needs more voice, more choice, more power. In the near term, we should pursue algorithmic accountability, independent auditing and consumer protection scrutiny, before we lose our agency as a public that is something other than their \u201cuser base.\u201d",

    "text": "\u2014 Taylor Torongo said she\u2019d never heard of the streak until she stepped on the court for her first varsity match.\n\nThe Los Banos senior said it was mentioned in passing right before the Tigers opened Western Athletic Conference play in 2013. Even though the seniors didn\u2019t make a big deal about it, the mention was enough to create a tension-filled afternoon as Torongo helped win her double match. She said the pressure to extend the streak has only gotten more intense in the years since then.\n\nTorongo\u2019s 6-2, 6-1 victory in No. 2 singles helped the Tigers make it 80 straight Western Athletic Conference victories on with a 6-3 win over Patterson on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cIt feels pretty good to keep it going, especially on this team as a singles player,\u201d Torongo said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of nerve racking having the streak going on 80, knowing the streak is behind you and that you don\u2019t want to let the team down.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of people that get to go their high school careers for any sport and never lose a conference game, so it\u2019s something special to be a part of and definitely something I want to make sure doesn\u2019t end this season.\u201d\n\nIt certainly doesn\u2019t appear that the streak is in any particular danger this season, though the new triple-round-robin format does present an added wrinkle. Patterson became the first team to take at least three points off of Los Banos (8-0 WAC) this season, but it wasn\u2019t LB\u2019s cleanest afternoon.\n\nHeat in the high 90s coupled with only four tennis courts at Patterson made for a long, sluggish afternoon. The fifth and sixth singles players and doubles teams had it the toughest, having to to try and get their energy back up after lounging in the sweltering heat for upwards of two hours. Patterson added a additional curve ball by running out an almost entirely different lineup than Los Banos had seen two weeks prior.\n\nThe end result was a more lethargic performance than usual, but even with less than the Tigers\u2019 best, Los Banos had the victory locked up before singles play was done. Shirley Liu, Adriana Moreno, Haley Ballez, and Kiara Azevedo joined Torongo with straight-set singles victories. The doubles pair of Corie Falaschi and Trinity Meza fought back from a set down to win the last two 6-4, 10-4 and give the Tigers a sixth point.\n\n\u201cThis is a long day and I think it\u2019s showing up in some of the results,\u201d LB coach Lynn Barcellos said. \u201cUsually we\u2019re done with the entire thing in a couple hours. It can be hard keeping your energy up when you\u2019re sitting around that long. You could see what happened, as some of the girls looked a little sleepy to start their matches. It took them a while to wake up and get going.\u201d\n\nAs for the streak lasting at least a couple more days.\n\n\u201cTechnically we\u2019re at more than 80,\u201d Barcellos said. \u201cWe count it from when we entered the WAC, but really it started the second half of my daughter, Alexis\u2019 freshman year. We went undefeated in the second round of CCC play and haven\u2019t lost since. It\u2019s special for me because my daughter\u2019s group helped get it going.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been able to keep it going because we\u2019ve been able to start working with kids at a younger age. I\u2019m out at the courts every weekend in the mornings and the evenings. We get great participation from our girls and boys teams and then have some of our alumni come out and play. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of younger kids to come out and play too, which has been huge. That way they have a fundamental understanding of the game when they get to high school.\u201d\n\nBarcellos said the other advantage they\u2019ve enjoyed during the run is the legacies that have come out and been a part of it. Liu is one such player, following her sister Tiffany.\n\n\u201cThe streak is really important, especially for me, because my sister was part of the group that started it,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a motivating force to keep it going. If we can continue it next year, we could hit 100 during my senior season. That would be pretty cool for my sister to be there at the beginning and for me to be there if we hit 100.\u201d\n\nSean Lynch: 209-385-2476, @MSSsports",

Owners who fail to microchip their pets with up-to-date contact details face a fine of up to \u00a3500.\n\nHowever, the survey found the number of stray dogs taken in by councils had decreased from 102,516 to 81,050 - a drop of 21 per cent.\n\n16,447 of these animals were microchipped - and 9,052 were able to be reunited with their owners.\n\nAdrian Burder, Dogs Trust\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cTo discover that the number of stray dogs in the UK is down from last year is promising, but with over 37,000 dogs remaining unclaimed in council pounds last year, it\u2019s clear we still have work to do.\n\n\u201cLocal authorities work tirelessly caring for stray and abandoned dogs each year, but sadly they just don\u2019t have the resources or manpower to care for every stray dog in the UK.\n\n\u201cStray dogs that find themselves at Dogs Trust are the lucky ones, as we will never put a healthy dog to sleep, but not all of the unclaimed dogs are so fortunate.\u201d",

    "text": "After a long absence from television studios, National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi appeared in a talk-show broadcast by the public broadcaster and expressed her points of view on the recent events and on some of the most resounding cases currently handled by DNA prosecutors.\n\nLaura Codruta Kovesi stated she still expects to receive intelligence from the Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE), in accordance to the law, and emphasised that the DNA did not have a conflict with SIE or with any other state institutions.\n\n\u201cDNA did not have a conflict with SIE or with other state institutions. According to the law, when an intelligence service gets hold of information related to corruption it has the obligation to notify us. I still expect to receive intelligence from SIE because that\u2019s what the law says. We don\u2019t have to have institutional relations, to meet, to sign protocols in order for them to do their job,\u201d Kovesi stated.\n\nThe Chief Prosecutor of the DNA emphasised that she does not know the reasons why Mihai Razvan Ungureanu resigned from the helm of SIE.\n\nAnswering a question about the dispute between SIE and DNA Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, President Klaus Iohannis stated on April 28 that he met her and SIE Director Mihai Razvan Ungureanu and considered the issue settled.\n\nAsked for his comments on DNA Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi\u2019s statement about SIE and whether he thinks SIE Director Mihai Razvan Ungureanu should resign, the President said at the time that he invited them for a talk.\n\n\u201cThis situation is caused by communication that is, probably, suboptimal. In order to clarify these aspects, I invited them both, I had talks with Laura Codruta Kovesi and SIE Director Mihai Razvan Ungureanu. It was a constructive discussion, things have been clarified and next they will jointly find solutions to the problems that might appear and to the misunderstandings between the two institutions. I consider the issue settled,\u201d Iohannis was saying.\n\nChief Prosecuted Codruta Kovesi stated in April that in recent years the DNA did not receive any reports from the Foreign Intelligence Service despite the fact that many defendants are opening bank accounts or purchasing assets abroad. She labelled the situation unacceptable.\n\nIn response to her accusations, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) pointed out at the time that it is not monitoring the activities of Romanian citizens abroad, and the intelligence gathered by it cannot be used as evidence in court since it is obtained through specific means, through espionage carried out on the territory of other states.\n\nDNA Chief on new request in Oprea case: President\u2019s green light requested in similar situations\n\nDNA Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi admitted in an interview for TVR on Monday evening that following Gabriel Oprea\u2019s resignation from Parliament the prosecutor handling the case could file a new criminal prosecution request with the Romanian President, giving the Miron Mitrea case as an example of a precedent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s premature to discuss before the resignation produces its effects. For the time being it has been filed, we are waiting for it to be read out in the plenum and published. In similar situations the President\u2019s green light was requested, and I can mention the Miron Mitrea case. The law does not stipulate any conditions in this sense. No other evidence was brought in the Mitrea case. After the resignation was published the case file and the request were sent to the President. We already have a precedent set by a Supreme Court ruling,\u201d Laura Codruta Kovesi stated on TVR.\n\nKovesi on Olguta Vasilescu\u2019s case file: Only a judge can tell us whether a case file is sound\n\nDNA Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi also stated that in Craiova Mayor Lia Olguta Vasilescu\u2019s case only judges can say whether there is evidence, the decision to eliminate some pieces of evidence in that case not being final.\n\n\u201cWhether the case files are flimsy, sound, big or small, it\u2019s for a judge to decide. The judge is the only one in the position to tell us whether there is sound evidence in this case. In this case we are talking about a case file in which other persons are involved too, besides Olguta Vasilescu. The case file is on the judge\u2019s table, in the court of first instance, no court ruling has been issued in what concerns guilt or innocence. We\u2019ll see what the judge\u2019s reasons are and we will abide by them. This year we have indicted eight hundred persons, six hundred have already received final sentences, some of them in case files finalised in previous years. The percentage of acquittals is stable. I\u2019ve heard stories that a case file is flimsy, there is no guilty act, that it\u2019s a political case, and later on we obtained convictions ruled by the court,\u201d the DNA Chief Prosecutor stated on TVR.\n\nThe Bucharest Court has decided to cancel some of the evidence included by the prosecution in the case file in which Craiova Mayor Lia Olguta Vasilescu is charged with passive bribery, misuse of authority or influence and money laundering. The decision is not final.\n\nPrivate companies paid large sums to intimidate DNA prosecutors. It\u2019s something new for Romania\n\nDNA Director Laura Codruta Kovesi stated on Monday evening on TVR that she has noticed lately a new approach in the attempt to intimidate DNA prosecutors, namely the hiring of private companies \u201cpaid lots of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil now we were used to being attacked through public statements made in various shows, on Facebook. Lately I\u2019ve seen that private companies are hired, being paid large sums of money, to come and intimidate DNA prosecutors. It\u2019s a new approach for Romania,\u201d Kovesi said. \u201cDNA prosecutors are too resilient, let\u2019s hire companies to harass and intimidate them,\u201d she added.\n\nAsked whether she felt intimidated following the Black Cube case in which two Israeli citizens \u2013 Weiner Ron and Geclowicz David \u2013 are accused of having tried to intimidate the Chief Prosecutor of the DNA, she answered: \u201cI don\u2019t think I look intimidated, I don\u2019t think anyone was intimidated within the DNA.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the attacks against the DNA have multiplied lately, coming particularly from persons investigated or \u201cfrom the politicians who support those persons.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cwe are used to being attacked,\u201d \u201cit has become the norm for a person investigated by the DNA to come out and levy all kinds of public accusations,\u201d the DNA Chief Prosecutor stated.\n\nShe pointed out that \u201cthere is no problem,\u201d considering that \u201cfreedom of expression is guaranteed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not worried. (\u2026) We are impressed and concerned about the dramatic effects of corruption,\u201d considering that there have been \u201cso many cases in which corruption resulted in deaths,\u201d Laura Codruta Kovesi added.\n\nInvestigation into 2009 presidential elections started in 2015 when notified upon\n\nAsked to comment the calumnious statements that ex-President Traian Basescu made about her, after his eldest daughter was placed under court supervision last Thursday in a case concerning illegal contributions in the 2009 presidential campaign, Kovesi answered: \u201cI won\u2019t comment on the calumnious public statements made by some persons.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that the investigation into the illegal contributions for the 2009 presidential campaign started last year, in 2015, after the DNA received some \u201cnotifications.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are guided or halted in our investigations by the statute of limitation only. As long as the statute of limitation has not operated, we, as prosecutors, have the mandate to investigate any act that is brought to our knowledge through a complaint or address lodged by an individual or legal person. In this very case, the investigation opened in 2015; we received notifications, the inquiry started, some evidence was provided, and we have reached this stage,\u201d Kovesi told the public broadcaster TVR 1 on Monday night.\n\nWhen asked whether former president Traian Basescu has any capacity in this case file, the DNA Chief Prosecutor said the persons involved in this case are revealed in the DNA communique.\n\nIoana Basescu, the eldest daughter of former President Traian Basescu, currently under conditional bail, is being prosecuted by the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) for incitement to malfeasance in office and money laundering.\n\nAccording to a DNA press release, the acts have to do with illegal contributions for the presidential campaign of 2009.\n\nIn the same case, prosecutors have started the criminal prosecution and have ordered a 60-day conditional bail measure for former Minister Elena Udrea, who is charged with five counts of money laundering; Gheorghe Nastasia \u2013 at the time of the offense General Secretary at the Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism (MDRT), charged with bribe taking, and Victor Tarhon, Chairman of the Tulcea County Council at the time of the offense, also charged with bribe taking.\n\nIoan Silviu Wagner is also prosecuted in this case, being charged with malfeasance in office if the civil servant sought to gain a benefit for self or for others. At the time of the offense he was manager of a company in which the state had the majority stake. Businessman Giovanni \u2013 Mario Francesco is also prosecuted in this case, being charged with tax evasion and money laundering.\n\n\u201cThere is no Ponta-Ghita-Blair case\u201d\n\nKovesi also stated that \u201cwithin the DNA there is no Ponta-Ghita-Blair case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a case in which we are investigating a businessman and a former party president. The investigation is ongoing; evidence is being gathered. Our role as DNA prosecutors is to carry out investigations into corruption crimes. This case contains corruption crimes that fall within the prerogatives of the DNA,\u201d the DNA Chief Prosecutor stated on TVR.",

    "text": "MIAMI: The world\u2019s first baby has been born using a controversial new technique by US scientists to include DNA from three parents in the embryo, said a report Tuesday.\n\nThe baby boy was born five months ago in Mexico to Jordanian parents, and is healthy and doing well, said the report in New Scientist magazine, described as an \u201cexclusive.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother carried genes for a disorder known as Leigh Syndrome, a fatal nervous system disorder which she had passed on to her two previous children who both died of the disease.\n\nShe had also suffered four miscarriages.\n\nThe woman, whose identity was withheld by New Scientist, and her husband sought the help of John Zhang, a doctor from the New Hope Fertility Center in New York City to have a baby that would be genetically related to them but would not carry the inherited disease.\n\nThe United States has not approved any three-parent method for fertility purposes, so Zhang went to Mexico where he was quoted by New Scientist as saying \u201cthere are no rules.\u201d\n\nOne method that has been approved in the United Kingdom, called pronuclear transfer, was deemed unacceptable to the couple because it would involve the destruction of two embryos, said the report.\n\nSince the mother carried the genes for the disease in her mitochondria, or DNA that is passed down from the maternal side, Zhang used her nuclear DNA and combined it with mitochondria from an egg donor, in a technique known as spindle nuclear transfer.\n\n\u201cHe removed the nucleus from one of the mother\u2019s eggs and inserted it into a donor egg that had had its own nucleus removed,\u201d said the report.\n\n\u201cThe resulting egg\u2014with nuclear DNA from the mother and mitochondrial DNA from a donor\u2014was then fertilized with the father\u2019s sperm.\u201d\n\nPresentation next month\n\nZhang and his team are expected to describe their method at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, next month.\n\nAn abstract describing the research has been published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, but outside experts said much more remains to be understood about the research.\n\n\u201cAs this technology is controversial and a world first, I think the investigators should have submitted a manuscript for full peer review instead of announcing these outcomes in this manner,\u201d said Justin St John, professor and Director of the Centre for Genetic Diseases at Monash University.\n\nAttempts began in the 1990s to create a baby by injecting mitochondrial DNA from a donor into the mother\u2019s egg, and adding sperm from her partner.\n\n\u201cSome of the babies went on to develop genetic disorders, and the technique was banned,\u201d said the New Scientist report.\n\n\u201cThe problem may have arisen from the babies having mitochondria from two sources.\u201d\n\nAnother outside expert, David Clancy, a lecturer at Lancaster University, recalled that experiments in monkeys have shown that maternal mitochondrial DNA can expand from low levels to significantly higher levels, \u201cwhich would allow disease to again be transmitted, so we must expect the possibility in humans.\u201d\n\nFor now, Zhang and his team said the boy\u2019s mitochondria has been tested and \u201cthey found that less than 1 percent carry the mutation,\u201d said the report.\n\n\u201cHopefully, this is too low to cause any problems; generally it is thought to take around 18 per cent of mitochondria to be affected before problems start.\u201d\n\nIn addition, his being a boy ensures that he could not pass down any inherited mitochondrial DNA.\n\n\u201cWhile we should remain vigilant about this technique as new information and research accumulates, let us hope this child grows up and has a long healthy life,\u201d said Clancy.

    "text": "Santhera Starts Phase III Study (SIDEROS) with Raxone in Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Using Glucocorticoids\n\n(Thomson Reuters ONE) -\n\nSanthera Pharmaceuticals Holding AG /\n\nSanthera Starts Phase III Study (SIDEROS) with Raxone in Patients with Duchenne\n\nMuscular Dystrophy Using Glucocorticoids\n\n. Processed and transmitted by Nasdaq Corporate Solutions.\n\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\n\n\n\nLiestal, Switzerland, September 28, 2016 - Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN)\n\nannounces that the first patient has been enrolled at the University of Kansas\n\nMedical Center (KUMC), Department of Neurology, Kansas (USA) in Santhera's\n\nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III (SIDEROS) trial. The\n\ntrial will assess the efficacy of Raxone in slowing the rate of respiratory\n\nfunction decline in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients receiving\n\nconcomitant glucocorticoids.\n\n\n\n\"We first observed the efficacy of Raxone in slowing the rate of respiratory\n\nfunction decline in DMD patients in both glucocorticoid-using and non-using\n\npatients in the phase II DELPHI study,\" commented Thomas Meier, PhD, CEO of\n\nSanthera. \"The successful Phase III DELOS trial which enrolled glucocorticoid\n\nnon-using patients then confirmed a clinically relevant and statistically\n\nsignificant benefit of Raxone treatment on pulmonary function. The now initiated\n\nPhase III SIDEROS trial is designed to confirm the efficacy of Raxone in\n\npatients experiencing respiratory function decline that are currently taking\n\nglucocorticoids. If successful, this study will provide data that support use of\n\nRaxone in all DMD patients experiencing respiratory decline irrespective of\n\ntheir glucocorticoid use. The high level of interest from investigators and the\n\npatient community should allow us to recruit this study quickly.\"\n\n\n\n\"We are hopeful that this phase III trial is the final step in the development\n\nprogram with Raxone in DMD,\" said Gunnar Buyse, MD, PhD, Professor of Child\n\n\n\nNeurology at the University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium) and SIDEROS PI and Lead\n\nInvestigator for Europe. \"Following the exploratory phase II program and the\n\nsuccessful phase III DELOS trial, I am grateful that Santhera is committed in\n\nexploring the full therapeutic potential of Raxone for patients with DMD.\"\n\n\n\n\"Maintaining pulmonary function in patients with DMD has only recently become a\n\nprominent therapeutic objective in DMD, particularly in non-ambulatory\n\npatients,\" added Oscar Henry Mayer, MD, Medical Director of the Pulmonary\n\nFunction Testing Laboratory at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Lead\n\nInvestigator for US. \"A patient and caregiver survey conducted by Parent Project\n\nMuscular Dystrophy clearly demonstrated that the DMD community highly values\n\ntreatment options for pulmonary complications.\"\n\n\n\nAbout the SIDEROS Trial\n\nSIDEROS is a phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with\n\nRaxone in approximately 260 DMD patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoids.\n\nPatients with declining respiratory function on any stable glucocorticoid\n\ntreatment scheme and irrespective of the underlying dystrophin mutation or\n\nambulatory status will be eligible. Study participants will receive either\n\nRaxone (900 mg/day; given as 2 tablets 3 times a day with meals) or placebo for\n\n78 weeks (18 months). The primary endpoint of the trial is change from baseline\n\nto week 78 in forced vital capacity % predicted (FVC%p). Secondary endpoints\n\ninclude changes from baseline in % predicted peak expiratory flow (PEF%p), time\n\nto first 10% decline in FVC and change from baseline in inspiratory flow\n\nreserve. Patients completing the trial will be offered the opportunity to enroll\n\nin an open label extension study where all patients receive Raxone. The study\n\nwill be conducted at about 50 centers in the United States and Europe. Patients\n\nwishing to enroll in the study should contact their neuromuscular clinic\n\nphysician. Further information about the study is available under\n\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\n\n\nAbout Raxone(\u00ae) (Idebenone) in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Regulatory Status\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most common and devastating\n\ntypes of muscle degeneration and results in rapidly progressive muscle weakness.\n\nDMD is characterized by a loss of the protein dystrophin, leading to cell\n\ndamage, impaired calcium homeostasis, elevated oxidative stress and reduced\n\nenergy production in muscle cells. This results in progressive muscle weakness\n\nand wasting and early morbidity and mortality due to respiratory failure.\n\n\n\nIdebenone is a synthetic short-chain benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme\n\nNAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) capable of stimulating mitochondrial\n\nelectron transport, reducing and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and\n\nsupplementing cellular energy levels.\n\n\n\nDELOS was a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which randomized\n\n64 patients, not taking concomitant glucocorticoids, to receive either Raxone\n\n(900 mg/day) or matching placebo. The trial met its primary endpoint and\n\ndemonstrated that Raxone can slow the loss of respiratory function and reduces\n\nbronchopulmonary complications.

    "text": "The Foreign Investors Council (FIC) encourages and supports the modernization of the National Agency for Tax Administration (ANAF), with the support of the World Bank, through the implementation of the Revenue Administration Modernization Project (RAMP), shows a press release issued on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMr. Dragos Doros, the President of ANAF, announced a variety of measures intended generally to reduce the fiscal burden both at the level of individuals and businesses. These were also discussed during a roundtable with FIC members on 20 September,\u201d reads the FIC release.\n\n\u201cANAF is moving online\u201d is the new motto ANAF embraces and expresses its ambition to transform itself into a modern and, as much as possible, digitalized institution. Public workers are encouraged to be more open to businesses, to communicate and guide them on fiscal matters. Cooperation should be the key characteristic of the relationship between authorities and tax payers.\n\nMr. Daniel Anghel \u2013 Vice President of FIC, underlined the constant request from firms towards ANAF to simplify procedures, especially when it comes to VAT and to make it easier to register, declare and pay VAT. In addition, he encouraged ANAF to continue the close cooperation with businesses and to move towards a voluntary compliance regime. FIC member companies believe that reducing the burdensome compliance and instead use technology to communicate with tax payers can lead to increased competitiveness of Romania in the region and make the life of companies much easier.\n\nMr Richard Perrin, co-chair of the FIC task force on Taxation said that a better transparency from ANAF as regards the criteria used for performing the risk analysis process in the context of VAT registration/deregistration would be helpful for the businesses and would create a\n\nbetter understanding by the latter of the approach of the tax authorities. Such transparency may decrease the level of controversy between business environment and ANAF.\n\nMr. Ismail Radwan, World Bank Lead Public Sector Specialist congratulated ANAF management and staff for tackling the resistance to change and introducing a new customer oriented approach within ANAF. He urged ANAF management to continue making progress on procuring the IT capacity both in terms of hardware, software and employees that would be needed to support the new improvements.\n\n\u201cIn this context, FIC encourages ANAF to continue its modernization efforts and our members will continue to support this process which will be beneficial both for the Romanian state and for the business environment,\u201d the press release informs.",

    "text": "Teamnet Group, one of the most important system integrators at the regional level, expands its activity in the Middle East, through a project developed for the Ministry of the Regional Municipality and Water Resources in Oman, in partnership with Modern Information Technology LLC (ITON) Group. The project, named \u201eMinistry Core Applications and eServices Portal\u201d, aims to implement a system that will issue online municipal authorizations. Thus, the two companies will support the digitalization and optimization of more than 400 types of services and 700 procedures related to areas such as public health, sanitation, constructions and water resources exploitation. On a market where IT investments of this year are estimated by Gartner at USD 212.9 billion in the Middle East, the solutions designed within this project are meant to reduce bureaucracy, to strengthen the decisional transparency and to facilitate communication with people.\n\nThe IT sector in the Middle East is growing, and Gartner specialists estimate that the business IT services will represent 84 percent of the total segment of the services in the field, while Enterprise software applications will record the highest growing rate in this year, in the Middle East. However, in terms of actual investments, the infrastructure software solutions will lead the top. Implementing technology in all the aspects of the life is a global concern, and Middle East is not apart from this trend, this being a priority both for Governments and for the business sectors.\n\n\u201cTeamnet\u2019s entrance in this region, as well as the expansion on all the markets in which we operate, is a result of our team\u2019s 15-year work in Romania and worldwide, in order to develop competitive solutions, globally acknowledged. Although in some countries we are at the beginning, as in Oman, in an extremely competitive global IT market, we estimate 70 percent growing results at the global level for Teamnet in this year, compared to last year\u201d, stated Bogdan Padiu, Teamnet Group CEO.\n\nAli bin Mohammed al Abri, Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of the Regional Municipality and Water Resources, stated to the press in Oman: \u201cThe agreement is the result of the efforts made by the Government to implement e-services which facilitate the relationship between us and the citizens. More than 400 types of services and 700 related procedures will be provided by electronic means\u201d. In his turn, Dr. Salim bin Sultan al Ruzaiqi, CEO of the Authority for the Information Technology (ITA), underlined the importance of this project, which serves a large number of citizens and companies.\n\nTeamnet will create the central system of the project, consisting in: Water Resource System, Technical Services System, Health Control System, Atlas GIS Services, as well as maintenance and support services, and it will also manage the data migration process. Modern Information Technology LLC, the project leader, will handle the implementation of the eServices portal, Case Management, Mobile Application, the hardware equipment delivery and licenses, the data migration and support and maintenance services.\n\nModern Information Technology LLC (ITON) is the most important IT software and services producer in Oman, operating also in the United Arab Emirates, India, USA, Canada and Australia. ITON clients portfolio include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Trade and Industry in Oman and others.\n\nIn 2015, Teamnet Group has recorded a consolidated turnover of more than EUR 110 million, 18 percent higher than the previous year.",

    "text": "Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nA plan to save almost \u00a319 million and transform Wokingham Borough Council into a 21st century authority is to go under the microscope this week.\n\nStaff will look at how the council can transform itself as Government grants become fewer before being removed altogether by 2020.\n\nThe council is looking to take advantage of the Government\u2019s offer of a multi-year settlement in place of its annual support grant.\n\nLeader Councillor Keith Baker said the plan offers \"financial certainty and some stability\" but said there are tough challenges ahead.\n\nIf the council approves the proposal at its meeting on Thursday, September 29, as well as a wide-reaching efficiency plan, the authority would write to the Secretary of State to accept the offer.\n\nThis would be on the proviso there is no negative revenue support grant in 2019/20.\n\nThe council has fought against the concept of a negative grant as it would mean residents subsiding those living in other places, which councillors and bosses felt was unfair.\n\nThe plan includes\n\nEmphasis on self-service to save on staffing\n\nFewer senior and middle managers\n\nReducing staff by 150 posts\n\nInvesting in improvements to save money in long-term\n\nFollowing a consultation, Greg Clark MP, then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, agreed no council would have a negative payment in 2017/18 and 2018/19.\n\nCllr Baker said: \"While taking up the offer of a four-year settlement gives us some financial certainty and some stability, we\u2019re under no illusions and must continue planning to make ourselves even more efficient during this time.\n\n\u201cIt will be challenging as we face the removal of the Government\u2019s revenue support grant by 2020.\n\n\u201cCoupled with the need to fund inflation and the growth in population which predominantly affects adult social care, children\u2019s services and waste disposal costs, which are partially funded by council tax increases, there is still a budget shortfall. This needs to be met with further savings.\"\n\nCllr Keith Baker: \"We\u2019re under no illusions and must continue planning to make ourselves even more efficient during this time.\"\n\nEven if it votes to accept the multi-year saving, the authority is by no means out of the woods financially.\n\nIt faces a shortfall of \u00a318.9 million between April 2016 and March 2020.\n\nIt has made a number of steps in the past to balance the books and protect its services.\n\nMeasures include a hike in council tax, rises in parking charges and a controversial reduction in grass cutting which led to many protests and an apology.\n\nHowever, it has become clear there now needs to be a radical and different approach to secure its medium to long-term future.\n\nThe council calls the project \u201c21st Century Council\u201d and has come up with a number of initiatives to reduce the shortfall.\n\nStaffing is likely to be hit, with a plan to save \u00a34 million a year by reducing its operation by 150 people.\n\nThat does not mean 150 redundancies though, as many positions within the council have been kept vacant unless it was deemed business critical.\n\nThe council also has to spend to save and will invest \u00a36.2 million in things like IT and training. It hopes to have made that money back in savings in two years.\n\nTaking into account the plans and saving plans already in place for 2016/17, the council still needs to find a saving of \u00a39.7 million over the next three years.\n\nPlans to do this include closer integration between health and social care, getting the best value for money from the council\u2019s big contracts and looking to share services with other authorities, as well as raising and generating income from the council\u2019s own companies.\n\nCllr Baker added: \"If approved, it would start immediately and be fully implemented by March 2018.\n\n\u201cThe business case focuses on the shape, structure and size of the organisation and how it would operate.\n\n\u201cThis is just one of 12 strands that would make savings. We would become a leaner, more efficient council costing significantly less to run. But I\u2019d like to assure our residents that it would be very much business as usual during the transition.\n\n\u201cAnd they should see availability and access to council services improve through digital channels; as well as swifter resolution of issues and queries.\u201d\n\nThe council is holding a number of public engagement events around the borough to discuss the budget and its financial challenges.\n\nThe sessions take place between 7pm and 9pm on:\n\nMonday, October 17 at St Mary\u2019s Church Centre, Station Road, Twyford\n\nThursday, October 20 at Maiden Place Community Centre, off Kilnsea Drive, Lower Earley\n\nMonday, October24 at The Bradbury Centre, Rose Street, Wokingham\n\nTuesday, October 25 at Finchampstead Baptist Church, Gorse Ride North, Finchampstead\n\nMonday, October 31 at Waingels College, Waingels Road, Woodley\n\nAnyone interested can just turn up on the night.",

    "title": "Earlier FAFSA Arrival Aids Some Students but Stresses Others",
    "text": "Millions of prospective college students can now complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on Oct. 1, three months earlier than previously allowed.\n\nThe new release date is intended to give students the opportunity to use the previous year\u2019s tax returns \u2014 a process called \u201cprior-prior\u201d \u2014 on the FAFSA instead of estimating their family\u2019s taxes for the current year.\n\n\u201cHistorically, the release date of the FAFSA has been Jan. 1,\u201d said Tobyn Friar, director of financial aid at Loyola University Chicago.\n\nThis means students might receive their financial aid awards sooner, which could influence their choice of college.\n\nColleges around the United States now have one main problem: getting the word out to ensure that students fill out their FAFSA on time. Although, there isn\u2019t a deadline to submit a FAFSA, some need-based awards are given on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n\nThe change does not only help those students from the United States, but also students around the globe.\n\nSylvester Alonz, a first-year history major from the Republic of Palau, an island in the Western Pacific, experienced several complications while ensuring that his financial aid would reach the United States this year.\n\n\u201cThe distance plays as a huge factor,\u201d said Alonz, 18. \u201cWith mail taking weeks on end to reach the mainland, paper applications were not a popular means of carrying [the FAFSA form] out. Even though we are still developing [the Republic of Palau\u2019s] internet connection, this was the most efficient way of getting everything done.\u201d\n\nAlonz said the new FAFSA release date will make applying for financial aid easier for Loyola\u2019s international students.\n\n\u201cHaving it at this time of the year is helpful because I can get everything done around a more effective time \u2014 the middle of the semester, when offices are open and services are active,\u201d Alonz said.\n\nBut, the new release date comes with drawbacks.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve had a change in income recently, the FAFSA might not reflect the most up-to-date information, which may lead to the filing of special circumstance appeals,\u201d Friar said.\n\nThe new date is also set at a busy time for students \u2014 the middle of the semester, around the time of midterms. The previous release date allowed students to focus on applying during winter break.\n\n\u201cCollege students like myself will be busy studying and cramming for midterms, since we\u2019re well underway through the academic school year.\u201d said Loyola first-year Daniel Collazo. \u201cFAFSA might end up being put on the back burner for most students, since they already have so much on their hands.\u201d\n\nThis new process will create more documentation on the administration\u2019s side, but the change is worth the hassle, according to Friar.\n\nJunior environmental policy major Jamie Wright was not aware that the date had been changed but said the earlier deadline will help her collect her information.\n\n\u201cWhenever I fill it out it\u2019s just like that one more thing on the list that is so, so crucial that I have to do and at the same time I don\u2019t understand it fully,\u201d said the 20-year-old. \u201cSo whenever I\u2019m going through I feel like I have to re-read it a bunch of times and make sure I have all the correct information.\u201d\n\nFriar said Loyola\u2019s Financial Aid Office will send email reminders to students, but he also is encouraging students to come to FAFSA workshops held through the Financial Aid Office if they have any questions. Workshops take place Oct. 16, 10-2 p.m., Oct. 19, 9-11 a.m., and Oct. 21, 1-3 p.m.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly important to not wait on questions; please, come in and ask for help,\u201d Friar said, \u201cWe will be able to walk you completely through what you need to do.\u201d",

They also enable students to develop the essential soft skills they will need for a successful career and for life more generally.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines do not prescribe how long work experience placements should last for, saying instead that the focus should be \u201con the quality and outcomes for students rather than the number of hours\u201d.\n\nSFC interim chief executive John Kemp said: \u201cColleges are already working well with employers and industry across the country and we want to make sure that every single student gets the benefit of this.\n\n\u201cFrom traditional placements to visits and simulation workplaces like in-college salons and restaurants, students really value work experience and with so many employers looking for experience as well as qualifications, so do employers - it makes a real difference to job prospects and future careers.\u201d",

    "title": "Teachers at Atta Mills SHS to be evicted over non-payment of rent",
    "text": "Some 25 teachers of the newly built Evans Atta Mills Senior High School (SHS) at Ekumfi Otuam in the Central Region, are being evicted by their landlords for non-payment of rent.\n\nThis follows government\u2019s failure to pay salaries of the teachers who were posted to teach at the school, named after the late Ghanaian leader, Professor John Evans Atta Mills, who hails from the town.\n\nThe rent per month for each of the affected teachers residing at Otuam, ranges between GHc35 and GHc45.\n\nMr. Kwame Kuntu Yawson, one of the landlords hosting one of the teachers, expressed frustration to Citi News over the teachers' failure to pay their rent.\n\nAccording to him, he has been charitable enough and would kick the teachers out by end of September if his rent is not paid.\n\nThe landlord said he is ready to give out his rooms to incoming students who are ready to pay for the rent.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, most of the teachers have not been able to renew the rent, and as a matter of fact, it is also causing me some problems because I have to renovate the house. When I consulted them what they told me was that, they\u2019ve not been paid for a year now. It\u2019s about a year now; so I am just planning on ejecting all of them from the house by the end of September and give it to the new students who are definitely going to give me money,\u201d he stated.\n\nSome of the teachers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed their frustrations about the development, and appealed to the government to expedite action on the payment of salaries.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the landlord always; but they would not listen to us because we don't have the money to pay them. They said renting it to the new students would help them get quick money in order to renovate the house. We are appealing to the government to release our salaries to us,\u201d he lamented.\n\nCiti News understands that, about 57 second year students, are yet to return to the school, although school reopened about a month ago.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities of the school have been tight-lipped on the matter.\n\nThe J. E. Atta-Mills SHS was commissioned on September 17, 2015, to fulfill a promise made by government in the 2012 manifesto to absolve the cost of secondary education in Ghana.\n\nIt is one of the ten community day senior high schools, following a promise by the government to build 200 of them. The idea of the community day school was to improve access, by also bringing the school very close to the students, but it appears that is a challenge for now.\n\nSome of the students are now left with no option than to come from longer distances.\n\n\u2013\n\nBy: Akwesi Koranteng/citifmonline.com/Ghana",

    "title": "Cafe Offers Modern Pancakes with Scandinavian Tradition",
    "text": "My mother came down from the suburbs over the weekend for Sunday brunch, and I was tasked with choosing a restaurant. I thought I would divert from the traditional American breakfast and look for something more exotic. We ended up eating at Pannenkoeken Cafe (4757 N. Western Ave), a cozy, family-owned Dutch cafe located in Lincoln Square, which can easily be accessed from the Wilson Brown Line stop. This cafe takes a modern twist on the traditional pannenkoeken: A thin, delicate pancake filled with seasonal fruit and cream.\n\nCafe owner Linda Ellis was inspired by Holland cuisine after traveling to the country for the first time in 2001. Ellis said she finds the inspiration for her dishes in Scandinavian cooking traditions, with a contemporary essence but incorporates new variations including apple, bacon and havarti, a Dutch cheese.\n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant looks like any dive you might see on the Food Network. However, inside the decor perfectly reflects the Scandinavian theme. Wooden clogs hang from the walls with hand-painted signs depicting different Dutch traditions. The restaurant contains less than 10 tables, making it feel intimate and quaint. The waitresses make the coffee and orange juice right in the front of the restaurant situated near the entryway for all to watch. The staff members were friendly, and you could tell by their thick accents that they were Scandinavian and found as much comfort in the traditional food as I did.\n\nI ordered the apple pannenkoeken ($10.50), a more traditional dish served at the cafe. On my enormous plate was a crisp, paper-thin pannenkoeken layered with sliced apples and topped with toasted hazelnuts and generous dollops of homemade whipped cream. The apples were tender and tart, which offset the sweet cream. When you take a bite, the buttery and flaky pannenkoeken melts in your mouth, perfectly complementing the sweet and salty candied hazelnuts. My mother ordered the seasonal peach pannenkoeken ($10.50) with a warm peach drizzle, chopped nuts and whipped cream. The peaches were plump and juicy, although the dish was not too sweet because the pannenkoeken itself was not flavored. The drizzle on top tied together the crunch of the nuts and the freshness of the decadent peaches. Every spoonful was a marriage of sweet and salty, bringing out the natural flavors of the fruits and the buttery, crisp layer of the pastry. Another excellent compliment to our brunch was the restaurant\u2019s freshly squeezed orange juice.\n\nIn addition to sweet pannenkoeken, the cafe offers savory varieties, french toast and egg dishes.\n\nTo avoid crowds and a long wait, you\u2019ll have to arrive early on the weekends or visit during the week. Pannenkoeken Cafe does not accept reservations and is cash only. This restaurant serves generous portions at a reasonable cost, especially for the quality of the food. I would recommend this restaurant to breakfast enthusiasts, admirers of Dutch culture and anyone that loves a friendly staff and fast service.\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more and looking at menu options, visit their website at: http://www.pannenkoekencafe.com/portfolio.html",

    "text": "Jeremy Corbyn is to announce plans to restore a multimillion-pound fund to help local communities deal with the impact of immigration.\n\nBut the Labour leader risks sparking a row within his own party, as aides said he was not making it an objective to reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK.\n\nThe announcement, in a keynote speech wrapping up Labour\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool, will come just hours after shadow home secretary Andy Burnham warns the party must \u201cface up fully\u201d to the fact that millions of its supporters \u201cvoted for change on immigration\u201d in the EU referendum.\n\nAnd it follows a warning from prominent backbencher Rachel Reeves of \u201cbubbling tensions\u201d over immigration which could explode into riots on the streets of Britain.\n\nMr Corbyn will also call on rebel MPs to \u201cend the trench warfare\u201d and accept the decision of members and supporters who backed him over challenger Owen Smith by 62%-38%.\n\nHe promised on Tuesday to announce new recruits to his depleted shadow ministerial team by the time Parliament returns on October 10, some of whom are expected to be among the dozens who quit the front bench in June in protest at his leadership.\n\nAnd he will put the party on notice to prepare for a snap general election in 2017, with aides making clear he is ready to vote for an early election if Prime Minister Theresa May seeks the dissolution of Parliament.\n\nIn a round of TV interviews, Mr Corbyn explained that he had been talking with socialist parties around Europe about the need for what he termed \u201cco-terminosity\u201d - harmonisation of wages and conditions - which he said could reduce incentives for workers from countries such as Poland or Bulgaria to come to the UK.\n\nAddressing the conference on Wednesday, he will call for action to stop employers using migrant workers to undercut the pay and conditions of home-grown staff.\n\nAnd he will say Labour would reinstate the Migration Impact Fund introduced by Gordon Brown in 2008 to help local communities respond to pressure on services such as schools, health and housing, but abolished by the coalition government in 2010.\n\nMr Brown\u2019s \u00a350 million scheme was funded by a \u00a350 visa levy on non-EU migrants. Mr Corbyn will boost its resources with a new citizenship application fee.\n\nHe will say: \u201cA Labour government will not offer false promises. We will not sow division or fan the flames of fear. We will instead tackle the real issues of immigration - and make the real changes that are needed.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the Labour leader believed that immigration levels - last month standing at 633,000 - needed to come down, an aide told reporters: \u201cJeremy is not concerned about numbers. Jeremy wants to ensure that people who come to work here have the same rights as British people and there is no undercutting of pay or conditions, which is driving wages down.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is not an objective to reduce the numbers, to reduce immigration. It is an objective to address the issues that are caused by immigration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the conference shortly before Mr Corbyn\u2019s address, Mr Burnham is due to say: \u201cLabour must face up fully to this fact: millions of our lifelong supporters voted to leave the EU and voted for change on immigration.\u201d\n\nAnd Leeds West MP Ms Reeves told a meeting on the fringe of the conference that the party must listen to voters\u2019 concerns, warning: \u201cWe have got to get this right because there are bubbling tensions in this country that I just think could explode.\n\n\u201cYou had those riots in 2011 ... if riots started again in Leeds and bits of my constituency - it\u2019s like a tinderbox.\u201d\n\nMs Reeves is one of a group of Labour moderates who have suggested that free movement must be restricted, even if it means losing full access to the single market.\n\nSetting out his plans, Mr Corbyn will say: \u201cWe will act to end the exploitation of migrant labour to undercut workers\u2019 pay and conditions. And we will ease the pressure on hard-pressed public services - services that are struggling to absorb Tory austerity cuts, in communities absorbing new populations.\n\n\u201cLabour will reinstate the Migrant Impact Fund, abolished by the Tory government. That will give extra support to areas of high migration. We will use the visa levy for its intended purpose. And we will add a citizenship application fee levy to boost the fund.\u201d\n\nAfter a conference which has seen centrist MPs vow to \u201cstay and fight\u201d rather than split the party and Corbyn supporters stage an alternative left-wing political festival, Mr Corbyn will urge Labour to come together behind 10 key pledges which will underpin the party\u2019s programme for office.\n\nThese are full employment; a secure homes guarantee; security at work; a strong public NHS and social care; a National Education Service; action on climate change; public ownership and control of services; cuts in income and wealth inequalities; action to secure an equal society; and peace and justice at the heart of foreign policy.\n\nHe will say: \u201cThe central task for the whole Labour Party is to rebuild trust and support to win the next general election and form the next government. That is the government I am determined to lead, to win power to change Britain for the better.\n\n\u201cBut every one of us knows that we will only get there if we accept the decision of the members, end the trench warfare and work together to take on the Tories.\n\n\u201cAnything else is a luxury that the millions of people who depend on Labour cannot afford.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn will insist there is \u201cevery chance\u201d Mrs May will \u201ccut and run for an early election\u201d.\n\nAnd he will add: \u201cI put our party on notice today. Labour is preparing for a general election in 2017, we expect all our members to support that effort, and we will be ready whenever it comes.\u201d\n\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said: \u201cAll this shows is that Jeremy Corbyn wants unlimited immigration - and presides over a Labour Party that is too divided, incompetent and distracted to lead our country.\n\n\u201cWhile Labour have lurched from one disaster to another this week, we will get on with the job of building a country that works for everyone.\u201d",

STUDY\n\nAround a fifth of bowel cancer patients diagnosed in A&E had \"red flag\" symptoms in the year leading up to diagnosis, research suggests.\n\nWith many patients visiting their doctor repeatedly in the 12 months prior to being told they had cancer, the study indicated potential missed opportunities to pick up the disease.\n\nExperts from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine examined National Cancer Registry data that was linked to GP data for 1,606 patients across more than 200 GP practices.\n\n110,000 'SANDWICH GENERATION' CANCER CARERS IN UK, SAYS MACMILLAN SUPPORT GROUP\n\nThe UK has around 110,000 \"sandwich generation\" carers who are looking after a parent with cancer and their own children, figures suggest.\n\nNew data from Macmillan Cancer Support estimates that almost one in 10 cancer carers are \"sandwich carers\", and most of them (89%) are also juggling a job.\n\nA new report from the charity, based on research among almost 900 cancer carers, found many suffer mental health problems as a result of caring, such as feelings of anxiety and depression.\n\nWILLIAM AND KATE FACE UP TO CULINARY CHALLENGE OF GEODUCK ON CANADA TOUR\n\nTasting regional delicacies is a tried and tested ritual of royal tours but the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge found themselves sampling a dish dubbed \"absolutely phallic\" by a chef while in Canada.\n\nDespite its unusual appearance William and Kate tucked into the geoduck - a giant saltwater clam - at a food and wine festival in British Columbia (BC) and appeared to enjoy the experience.\n\nThe couple marvelled at the creature's long neck which can be a little off-putting to the uninitiated.\n\nPIPPA MIDDLETON ACTION AGAINST 'PERSONS UNKNOWN' SET FOR HIGH COURT\n\nLawyers representing the Duchess of Cambridge's sister are preparing to appear at the High Court.\n\nPippa Middleton has taken legal action against a \"person or persons unknown\".\n\nShe is listed as the claimant in a case scheduled to be heard at the High Court in London on Wednesday.",

(Non urgent and non emergency.)\n\n* Regularly audit children\u2019s admissions to hospital with particular reference to length of stay and costs.\n\n* Move services out of hospitals to be delivered in a community setting.\n\nMembers of Fighting 4 Hartlepool Hospital outside the hospital in Holdforth Road, Hartlepool.\n\n* Integrate community, local authority and hospital services wih general practice.\n\nAfter the meeting, Prof Colin-Thome said: \u201cThe health of people in Hartlepool could be better.\n\n\u201cThis is a new care model for Hartlepool which would see more services delivered in community settings than they are now.\n\n\u201cIt would move services out of hospital into a community setting and it would work closer with community pharmacies, GPS and the local hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt would provide capacity in the right part of the system with a trained and competent workforce.\n\n\u201cIt would integrate the community, local authority and hospital services with general practice.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cPeople are going to North Tees for a lot of things they don\u2019t need to, and I think that needs to get back into Hartlepool.\n\n\u201cLocal people are getting back control of most of their services, as the majority of stuff can be done locally, with health and social care working together.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting Gill Alexander, Hartlepool Borough Council\u2019s chief executive, agreed that although the model aims to deliver the majority of services locally, some treatment would need to go to hospitals outside the town.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe need services in the community which are more joined up, but some specialist services need to be provided outside the town because the volume of people who need the services won\u2019t be justified.\u201d\n\nA spokesman from Hartlepool Borough Council said on the model: \u201cProfessor David Colin-Thom\u00e9, the independent chair of the Local Health and Social Care Plan Working Group, delivered his findings and recommendations to the group at a meeting on Monday evening.\n\n\u201cProfessor Thome\u2019s report will now be fully considered by the council in due course.\u201d\n\nThe North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust was unable to comment.\n\nThe full report will be presented to the Health and Wellbeing Board on October 17, the Clinical Commissioning Group Governing Body on October 25 and Hartlepool Council on October 27.",

    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- It will likely be months before an investigation into what caused a boat crash that killed Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez and two other men early Sunday morning is complete.\n\nBut local boating experts said it is probable that judgment errors by the vessel's operator resulted in the fatal accident.\n\nFernandez, 24; Eduardo Rivero, 25; and Emilio Macias, 27, were killed when the 32-foot SeaVee they were aboard slammed into rocks off the Government Cut channel just southeast of Miami Beach.\n\nAuthorities said the boat was traveling south at full speed -- at least 40 mph, experts say -- when it struck jetty rocks and flipped. Divers found two bodies under the boat and a third on the ocean floor.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Fernandez owned the boat -- Kaught Looking -- but has not determined who was in control when it crashed.\n\nThomas Danti, dean of instruction at the Chapman School of Seamanship in Stuart, Fla., has navigated the area where the accident occurred and said it does not provide any extraordinary challenges.\n\n\"Government Cut is a commercial inlet with big ships -- tankers and cruise ships -- going in and out of there,\" Danti said. \"It's very well marked. It's a very wide inlet. It just doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nA navigational chart of Government Cut shows a buoy just at the end of the jetty that flashes every four seconds to warn boaters. Danti said it's possible the boat operator misjudged his location thinking he was further out and cut inside the buoy, causing it to slam into the rocks.\n\n\"When you're out at night on a boat, you're driving blind,\" Danti said. \"You have no headlights and you can't stop a boat like you do a car. You really have to watch your speed.\"\n\nRichard Wood, who runs safety classes for the Palm Beach Sail and Power Squadron, said the rule of thumb for nighttime boating is that operators must be able to stop their vessel in one-half the distance of their visibility. In other words, if the operator can see only 100 yards ahead of the boat, he must be able to stop within 50 yards or less.\n\nEven factoring in speed, Wood said it was hard for him to believe that the crash took place on the Government Cut jetty.\n\n\"You'd have to be almost unconscious to miss that because it's meant for navigation by big commercial ships,\" Wood said.\n\nWood said that the jetty rocks were likely invisible at night. Some boats are equipped with radar, a forward-looking infrared system or even a spotlight, but it's unknown if the Kaught Looking had any of those instruments on board.\n\nWithout any of that equipment, \"there's nothing, zero, zip, zilch that tells you that you're going to hit something,\" Wood said.\n\nThere were 737 reported boating accidents and 55 fatalities across Florida in 2015, more than any other state, according to the FWC's Boating Accidents Statistical Report. Florida leads the nation with nearly 1 million registered vessels.\n\nMiami-Dade County had more boating accidents last year than any other Florida county with 96 crashes resulting in three fatalities and 42 injuries. The two most common types of crashes were collisions with other vessels (33) and collisions with fixed objects (17).\n\nSports on 09/28/2016",

Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2016. (Jeff Siner/The Charlotte Observer via AP) mb.com.ph\n\nCorine Mack, president of the local NAACP chapter, said blacks typically are \u201cdemonized\u201d after being killed by police.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any of that,\u201d Mack said at a news conference Tuesday announcing demands that include implementation of police reforms approved last year.\n\nCourt documents say Keith Lamont Scott had a restraining order filed against him a year ago when he threatened to kill his wife and her son with a gun.\n\nKeith Scott\u2019s wife filed the order Oct. 5, that law enforcement officers who encounter him should be aware that he \u201ccarries a 9mm black\u201d gun. Police have said Scott had a handgun when they approached him at an apartment complex last week.\n\nOfficers told Scott repeatedly to drop the weapon and he was shot to death when he didn\u2019t follow their orders, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney has said.\n\nScott\u2019s family has said he was not armed. Videos released by police and the family are inconclusive, and state authorities are investigating. Protests over the shooting spanned the past week, and some of those protests turned violent. Charlotte streets were mostly quiet Tuesday night for the first time since the shooting.\n\nTuesday evening, the police headquarters building had to be evacuated as a bomb squad checked out a suspicious package. A robot removed the package from the building and police said on their Twitter page that the package was taken to a remote location to be rendered harmless.\n\nIn the restraining order last fall, Rakeyia Scott sought to keep her husband away because \u201che hit my 8-year-old in the head a total of three times with his fist,\u201d she said in the restraining order.\n\n\u201cHe kicked me and threaten to kill us last night with his gun,\u201d she said in the order filed in Gaston County, where the couple then lived. \u201cHe said he is a \u2018killer\u2019 and we should know that.\u201d\n\nRakeyia Scott checked boxes on the form informing law officers who would serve the restraining order that her husband had neither a permit issued by a county sheriff to buy a handgun nor a state permit to carry a concealed handgun, which requires a criminal background check. She said he worked as a mall security guard.\n\nWhen deputies went to serve the restraining order two days after it was filed, Scott had already moved to South Carolina, where he has family. About a week after that, Rakeyia Scott filed a separate court notice voluntarily dismissing the order, saying: \u201cHe is no longer a threat to me and my family.\u201d\n\nIn a video released last week capturing the moments before and after Scott was shot by police, Rakeyia Scott can be heard telling officers: \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him! He has no weapon.\u201d\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police said they found Scott\u2019s DNA and fingerprints on a handgun recovered at the scene and that he was wearing an ankle holster when he was killed.\n\nPolice released a photo of a small, black handgun they said was recovered from the scene of Scott\u2019s shooting on Sept. 20. Police have not described the gun in detail, but printing on the side of the barrel said it was a Colt Series 80 Mustang .380 caliber, which shoots a 9mm bullet, according to Steven Howard, a firearms consultant in Lansing, Michigan, who has testified as an expert witness in court cases.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the gun mentioned in the restraining order is the same one police said they recovered.",

    "title": "Razorback report: Defense up for QB run Saturday",
    "text": "FAYETTEVILLE -- The Arkansas defense is preparing for a capable quarterback run game from Alcorn State.\n\nIt's not like they haven't seen it already this season. Texas A&M's Trevor Knight presented the third quarterback run-heavy scheme Arkansas has faced, following Louisiana Tech and TCU. Texas State also runs its quarterbacks, but the Razorbacks snuffed out that threat.\n\nKnight was a different story, amassing a career-high 157 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"Trevor Knight ran the ball well,\" defensive end Deatrich Wise Jr. said. \"He pretty much led that team to a victory.\"\n\nAlcorn State freshman quarterback Noah Johnson ranks third on the team in rushing with 128 yards and is second with 29 attempts. Johnson has scored four of the team's six rushing touchdowns.\n\n\"The freshman really gets it done,\" safety Josh Liddell said. \"Watching his tape, that guy can really run.\"\n\nJohnson has been playing more than junior starter Lenorris Footman, who suffered an ankle injury early in the year. Footman has nine carries for 39 yards.\n\n\"We've just got to make sure we do better than last week and are not giving up big plays, that's for sure,\" defensive line coach Rory Segrest said.\n\nSantos spotlight\n\nCoach Bret Bielema's 12-play highlight package from the Texas A&M game, shown to the team on Sunday night, had an array of negative plays, but it also included plays that showed extra effort.\n\nSafety Santos Ramirez was in on three of them.\n\nThe sophomore forced a fumble from punt returner Christian Kirk that Arkansas recovered and converted into a touchdown early in the first quarter. Ramirez tracked down Trayveon Williams at the end of a 15-yard run to the Arkansas 2 early in the third quarter and linebacker Dre Greenlaw recovered an Aggie muff on the next play. Ramirez also chased down quarterback Trevor Knight at the end of a 62-yard run late in the game.\n\n\"It's always great to get praise for your attitude and your effort,\" Ramirez said. \"Those two things you can always control. That's what I pride myself on and to know that Coach gave me praise about that, it made me feel good about myself.\"\n\nDefensive backs coach Paul Rhoads said Ramirez did a lot of things well, but \"overall, there wasn't anybody that graded out in a positive way. But he caused a fumble and he had two touchdown-saving tackles.\"\n\nLate to early\n\nDefensive end Deatrich Wise talked about the weirdness of playing an 11 a.m. game in Little Rock the week after kicking off at 8:15 p.m. on the road.\n\n\"That was a long wait,\" Wise said. \"We were watching everybody else play and having meetings, taking a break, and meeting again. It got tedious.\"\n\nThe morning kickoff seems to suit players better.\n\n\"We have to make sure we go to bed earlier and get a good night's sleep,\" Wise said. \"Hydrate throughout the week because of the early game.\n\n\"I feel like that's a pretty good time to play. You get up and feel fresh and go play, instead of having to wait all day for the game.\"\n\nCoach Bret Bielema said he had a whole season at Wisconsin with 11 a.m. kickoffs.\n\n\"Saturday's the only day that you get a moment to rest and I was excited to see that 11 o'clock game, but we'll see how everybody responds to it. ... I think our wake-up time is right around 6:30 or 7 o'clock.\"\n\nRed zone rebuff\n\nArkansas' red-zone scoring ratio took a beating last week with three non-scoring drives inside the Texas A&M 20 out of seven chances.\n\nThe Razorbacks' overall success rate is now 18 of 23 (.689), which ranks 87th in the NCAA. Arkansas' touchdown-scoring rate in the red zone (15 of 23, .652) is 57th. The team's five red zone failures came on an interception, a missed field goal, a fumble and two losses on downs.\n\nCapps is OK\n\nDefensive tackle Austin Capps, who missed last week's game against Texas A&M with an eye contusion, practiced Tuesday.\n\nDefensive line coach Rory Segrest said he expects Capps to be ready to play Saturday.\n\n\"His swelling's gone down,\" Segrest said. \"We're keeping a close eye on him, but right now he's in good shape.\"\n\nCapps suffered the injury in a scooter accident.\n\n\"Those things don't have a lot of protection,\" Segrest said. \"Any time you have an accident, there are some bad things waiting to happen. Fortunately, he came out of it OK.\"\n\nBack in the Rock\n\nAlcorn State will be playing a University of Arkansas team in early October in Little Rock for the second consecutive year. Last season, the Braves defeated Arkansas-Pine Bluff 61-14 in War Memorial Stadium on Oct. 3, 2015.\n\nIt's All-Corn\n\nAlcorn State is frequently pronounced a couple of different ways, but the correct pronunciation is All-Corn. The school explains the pronunciation on the front page of its football notes by saying it's \"All-Corn\" as in \"Always Alcorn.\"\n\nSack chat\n\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks, who rank fifth in the SEC in sacks, will face one of the FCS's hardest teams to sack on Saturday.\n\nAlcorn State is one of six FCS teams to have allowed one sack or less this season.\n\nKarl Roesler joined Arkansas' sack parade last week with a 5-yard takedown against Trevor Knight. Ten Razorbacks have accounted for at least a partial sack, led by Jeremiah Ledbetter (2.5) and Deatrich Wise (2.0). Arkansas is No. 32 nationally with 2.75 sacks per game.\n\nOn the flip side, Alcorn State has posted 14 sacks in three games, the second-highest total in the SWAC, led by 6.5 from linebacker Darien Anderson.\n\nSports on 09/28/2016",

Neither Dataram nor his wife was present at the Georgetown Magistrates\u2019 Court.\n\nIn her ruling Magistrate Latchman noted that a prima facie case had not been made out against Boodnarine, Gouveia and Charran. She said that given the circumstance of insufficient evidence, the three latter accused were not guilty of the crime.\n\nMagistrate Latchman, however fined the convicted drug lord (Dataram) $164,268,000 and sentenced him to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for being in possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Gouveia and Charran walked briskly out of the courtroom. The men were obviously relieved at the outcome.\n\nDataram, a Guyana-born American, had successfully fought off efforts to extradite him to the United States of America to face drug smuggling charges.\n\nDataram is said to have since fled Guyana to neighbouring Suriname. Law enforcement authorities had confirmed that the man had travelled out of Guyana on false documents. The authorities are however, unsure whether his reputed wife had travelled with him.\n\nAt the previous hearing attorney for the defendants, Glenn Hanoman, made an application for leave of the court to withdraw services on the grounds that he was unaware of the whereabouts of Dataram and Boodnarine.\n\nThe lawyer said that he has not been able to communicate with the couple since their last court appearance. The application was granted by the court.\n\nHanoman, nevertheless, was still the attorney of the other two persons.\n\nDataram, also known as \u2018Mogotani\u2019, or Kevin Dataram, of 13 Vriesland, West Bank Demerara; his reputed wife, Anjanie Boodnarine, 19, of 79 Patentia, Housing Scheme, West Bank Demerara; Komal Charran, 20, of 265 Belle West, West Bank Demerara; and Trevor Gouveia of Best Village, West Coast Demerara, had all pleaded not guilty to a drug trafficking charge.\n\nAccording to the allegation, on April 16, last, at 661 Fourth Avenue, Block X Diamond, East Bank Demerara, they allegedly had 129.23 kg of cocaine in their possession for the purpose of trafficking.\n\nThe couple was arrested at their Lot 661 Fourth Avenue, Block X Diamond, East Bank Demerara residence. On the day in question, ranks from the Customs Anti Narcotic Unit (CANU) swooped down on the house and conducted a search in the presence of the defendants. During the search they unearthed the illicit drug.\n\nIt was reported that some of the cocaine was stuffed in frozen seafood, while the remainder was found to be bricks of raw coke.\n\nAs a result, Barry Dataram who was in the house at the time of the bust with his reputed wife and three other persons, was arrested. The defendants were then told of the offence, arrested and charged.",

The shop had been issued with a warning two years earlier about illegally selling food beyond its use by date.\n\nMr Mahmood could also not show he was managing food safety risks as required by law.\n\nThe officer warned Mr Mahmood of the dangers and that he must not sell out of date sandwiches but when he revisited the shop to check, he found the warning had been ignored.\n\nStaff were using dangerous electrical equipment which exposed them to the risk of potentially fatal electric shocks.\n\nWhen an officer visited on February 24 he found two packets of gammon steaks with a use by date of February 13, one pint of semi-skimmed milk, with a use by date of February 21, and a chicken and stuffing sandwich to be used by February 17 and a chicken tandoori sandwich dated February 23.\n\nSTEVE ALLEN\n\nWhen he revisited three days later he found him selling one chicken and stuffing sandwich, with a use by date of February 24 and two packets of chicken tikka sandwiches with use by dates of February 25.\n\nMr Mahmood was fined a total of \u00a32,150 for the offences, ordered to pay \u00a32444 in costs and a victim surcharge of \u00a371.\n\nSpeaking after the case, Councillor David Lancaster, lead member for environment and community safety, said: \u201cThe use by date on food is there to protect people and must not be ignored.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with businesses and help them thrive in the city, but if they flout the law we will not hesitate to take action to protect the public and staff who work there.

PHOTO | BARACK ODUOR\n\nThe Mbeo family is practising a different kind of fish farming on the shores of Lake Victoria. Whereas most fishermen row their boats deep into the lake in hope of bringing back big stocks, the Mbeos simply go into big cages and catch as much as they want.\n\nSHARE THIS STORY Tweet\n\nTheir firm, Lake View Fisheries, is Kenya\u2019s cage fishing pioneer, winning several entrepreneurial and environmental conservation awards in the three years it has been up and running.\n\nLike most new ventures, Lake View Fisheries started as and idea that would not give its bearer any rest until it was executed. One of the Mbeo siblings, Gilbert, always had a passion for fish farming and shared his ideas with his family. In 2013, the family took a collective risk and invested most of their savings into his passion.\n\nGilbert had over the years done his research and learnt a lot about pond farming and cage farming. He realised that in a small area on the lake one could keep a large number fish compared to a pond.\n\n\u201cWhen we decided to go with this style of farming we knew we had to reach out for expertise because such cages have not been seen in Kenya, says Gilbert.\n\nAnd so they consulted experts from Africa\u2019s biggest cage farms to understand best practices on cage management before setting up on Ramba Beach in Mfangano Island.\n\nThe farm is characterised by floating circular high-density polyethylene (HDPE) cages, a technology mostly applied in mariculture.\n\nIt has two circular HDPE cages with a capacity of 25 tonnes. Each is made of high density pipes surrounded by green nets with a 20 metre diameter and depth of six metres.\n\nThe cages use a series of up to four nets: the actual net that holds the fish, predator net, feed containment net measure to contain the feed so that it doesn\u2019t spill out and finally the bag net that covers the cage to keep away predators such birds.\n\nThe company runs a tilapia hatchery, 31 ponds, two demonstration square cages and circular HDPE cages.\n\nBefore the fish are released into the cages in the lake, eggs are hatched in and incubation room using re-circulation aquaculture system.\n\nThe cages hold a brooding stock of 2,000 tilapia fish while the company currently produces over 100,000 sex reversed fingerlings in a month. Each fingerling costs between Sh5 to Sh10 depending on the size.\n\n\u201cWe went through several months of developing our brood stock, which involves cycles of breeding and selecting the most favourable genetics and traits fit for cage farming,\u201d says Gilbert\u2019s sister, Michelle Mbeo, a Lake View Fisheries co-director.\n\nSome of the daily activities include scuba diving to inspect different cage parts, feeding and monitoring fish health.\n\n\u201cWe are building a team by up skilling local talent to ensure that this skill set is available in Kenya. Currently we have two employees being trained in Mombasa. Our target is to train 20 staff members,\u201d says Gilbert.",

    "title": "Report highlights FOI improvements",
    "text": "A new report published today (Wednesday, September 28) has found that most Scottish public authorities appear to be getting better at handling Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.\n\nThe report, published by the Scottish Information Commissioner, reveals that less than 1% of the 68,000 FOI requests made in Scotland last year were appealed to the Commissioner.\n\nThe report also reveals that the number of appeals investigated by the Commissioner following an authority\u2019s failure to respond to an FOI request fell significantly \u2013 from 94 in 2013/14 to 61 this year.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of her 2015/16 Annual Report, Scottish Information Commissioner Rosemary Agnew said: \u201cThese signs of improvement in FOI performance are welcome. As my report demonstrates, the majority of information requests result in some or all of the information being disclosed. It is encouraging that only a very small proportion of requests are appealed. I\u2019m also pleased that the number of appeals made about a failure to respond has fallen significantly following our work to tackle this issue.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our experience is that these improvements are not universal. There is still a clear gap between the best performing authorities and those who lag behind. As you will see from my report, my focus still lies in promoting good practice and intervening when I find poor practice.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner\u2019s 2015/16 Annual Report reveals that:\n\n540 appeals were made to the Commissioner in 2015/16. This is a 14% increase on last year, but is down from 578 appeals two years ago.\n\nThe number of \u201cfailure to respond\u201d appeals fell significantly in 2015/16. The Commissioner accepted 61 \u201cfailure to respond\u201d cases for investigation. This was 16% of her investigation caseload \u2013 a significant reduction on the 25% three years ago.\n\nAppeals volumes fell for some sectors. Most notably for the Scottish Government and its agencies, where appeals fell from 23% of the Commissioner\u2019s caseload in 2014/15 to 15% this year (from 111 appeals to 84).\n\nAppeal volumes increased for others. Appeals in relation to non-departmental public bodies increased, from 6% of the Commissioner\u2019s caseload in 2014/15 to 10% this year. This was largely due to an increase in Scottish Fire and Rescue Service appeals, from one in 2014/15 to 12 this year.\n\nThere was also a significant increase in appeals about requests made to Police Scotland. They rose from 9% of appeals last year to 15% in 2015/16 (from 45 to 81 appeals). 3% of Police Scotland\u2019s information requests resulted in an appeal, compared to a national average of 0.8%.\n\n61% of appeals came from members of the public. The media accounted for 20% of appeals, and prisoners 7%.\n\n60% of the Commissioner\u2019s decisions found wholly or partially in the requester\u2019s favour. If an authority has incorrectly withheld information, the Commissioner\u2019s decision will require it to be released.\n\n73% of cases were resolved by the Commissioner within four months.\n\nPublic authorities reported receiving 68,156 information requests in 2015/16. This is a 2% increase on 2014/15. Figures are reported in a publicly-available database set up by the Commissioner. The portal data also shows that 75% of requests resulted in some or all of the requested information being provided, and that public authorities themselves are reporting 35% fewer \u2018failures to respond\u2019 to information requests since 2014/15.\n\nPublic awareness of FOI is at its highest ever level, at 85%. This is up from 84% last year, and 78% in September 2013.\n\nFOI awareness is lower amongst 16-24 year olds. Ipsos MORI polling also revealed lower awareness amongst young people. The Commissioner is working in partnership with Young Scot to address this lower awareness.\n\nRosemary Agnew added: \u201cWe are also conscious of how important it is we perform well. We appreciate that it is frustrating for requesters, who have already had to wait for several months, if our investigations are unnecessarily protracted. It can also be stressful for authorities who have to wait for the outcome of our investigations. When someone has to appeal, we work hard to resolve the issue quickly, with 73% of our cases taking no more than four months, and 60% of our decisions finding wholly or partly in the requester\u2019s favour. The focus now must be on making it work even better at every stage.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner\u2019s full Annual Report and Accounts for 2015/16 is available at: www.itspublicknowledge.info/AnnualReport201516",

At the same time, the Constitutional Court will hear on Wednesday an application by Joice Mujuru who is contesting the introduction of the notes.\n\nin the money with NESBERT RUWO & JOTHAM MAKARUDZE\n\nThe notes will circulate at par with the US dollar, that is at one bond note to one US dollar. The US dollar proxy will be backed by a $200 million countercyclical facility from African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank). A maximum of an equivalent of $200 million in the surrogate currency will be introduced into the system. It is anticipated that bond notes equivalent to about $75 million will be circulating by end of December 2016.\n\nThe bond notes will be introduced under an export incentive scheme, which is aimed at promoting the export of goods and services while stemming US dollar capital flight from Zimbabwe. The surrogate currency\u2019s convertibility will be limited only within the borders of Zimbabwe. You may not transact in the bond currency in other countries outside of Zimbabwe as the notes are not technically a legal tender. If this export incentive capital flight plug equation works, by encouraging exports and while simultaneously reducing capital flight, Zimbabwe could build up its foreign reserves quite quickly. But this is a simplistic view. Imports are so entrenched into the economy that to compete with these imports \u2014 some of them so cheap \u2014 the local industry needs to invest in recapitalising its capacity. The world has moved on in terms of technology and processes during the \u201clost decade\u201d that most Zimbabwean manufacturers and service providers may require significant investment in the newest and efficient technologies to compete in a global market. This extensive investment would require that both local and international investors be confident about the future of the country. This confidence is a precursor for rebuilding the economy. On the other hand, given that the export incentive is backed up by a loan facility, the cost to the fiscus of funding a 5% export incentive should be less than the benefit that will flow through from increased exports for it to make economic sense.\n\nThe bonds will be availed to exporters and will filter into the rest of the system as beneficiary exporters transact. As we noted in our May 2016 instalment, most people in the country view this introduction as a pre-cursor for the re-introduction of a domestic currency in which the RBZ will have much control over. While this bond note introduction is part of a bouquet of solutions to address the liquidity crunch in the country, the authorities should not ignore the memories people have of the hyperinflation eight years back, when official inflation crested at 79,6 billion percent. No sovereign currency can sustain its value in such an environment. It was a period of \u201cfinancial madness\u201d in which the citizenry lost all its hard-earned savings. Imagine for once what happened to people\u2019s pensions, which ordinarily should have been \u201cprotected\u201d under fund management mandates. The fundamental investment objective of retirement funds is to administer funds in such a way as to provide for the retirement objectives. Boards of management have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries that the benefits provided for in terms on the rules of the funds they manage are actually delivered. But our pensioners and savers lost virtually everything. Can we just ignore the pain of people losing everything they worked for? Who should carry the responsibility for that financial madness? It is questions like these and the pain that people experienced that has usurped people\u2019s confidence in supporting the re-introduction of a local currency, in whatever form the currency is in, before the right conditions prevail.\n\nThe RBZ stated that the bond notes \u201cshall not be forced on people\u201d. The aggregation of millions of individual decisions will point to the acceptability of these soon-to- be-introduced notes. The market has a way of valuing an asset or a currency. It is widely acknowledged that money derives value based on the public\u2019s willingness to support the face value of the notes or coins. Banking is all about trust \u2014 if people cannot trust the existing system, the unfortunate outcome is that people will revert to the \u201cblack market\u201d and trade in a currency they trust. Rightly so, the RBZ governor pointed out that the conditions for the return of the local currency are not yet prevailing.\n\nThe message from international investors is clear \u2014 Harare\u2019s biggest challenge is the politics. Fundamental issues still need to be addressed to encourage local investment, production, policy consistency and build people\u2019s trust on the country\u2019s monetary and fiscal system. The country is competing for global capital and markets like any other country. We, however, are not sure how the introduction of \u201csmaller denominations of bond notes of $2 and $5\u201d will address the \u201cpublic\u2019s concerns, fear, anxiety and scepticism around bond notes\u201d. It\u2019s a matter of time before we know whether the bond notes will survive the test of trust.\n\nNesbert Ruwo (CFA) and Jotham Makarudze (CFA) are investment professionals based in South Africa.

    "text": "Sainsbury\u2019s today posted a second consecutive quarterly fall in sales as it remained under pressure amid the bitter supermarket war and food price deflation.\n\nBritain\u2019s second-biggest grocer, which recently completed its \u00a31.4 billion takeover of Argos, reported a 1.1 per cent drop in like-for-like sales excluding fuel for the second quarter.\n\nChief executive Mike Coupe said: \u201cWe continue to make progress against our strategy and, while like-for-like sales were down 1.1 per cent, driven by food price deflation, we delivered like-for-like transaction growth across all channels and total volume growth.\u201d\n\nSainsbury\u2019s added that Argos notched up like-for-like sales growth of 2.3 per cent during the period, with Coupe saying the group will open 200 new digital collection points by the end of the year. Thirty Argos digital outlets will be open in Sainsbury\u2019s stores by Christmas.\n\nThe grocer is slugging it out with rivals in a brutal price war which has eroded margins at all of the so-called big four supermarkets.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s pledged to \u201cremain competitive\u201d, adding that it has made further investments in the prices of everyday items such as broccoli, onions and its frozen deep pan margherita pizza.\n\nCoupe said: \u201cWe expect the market to remain competitive and the effect of the devaluation of sterling remains unclear. However, Sainsbury\u2019s is well positioned to navigate the changing marketplace and we are confident that our strategy will enable us to continue to outperform our major peers.\u201d\n\nHowever, John Ibbotson, director of consultancy Retail Vision, said the grocer had \u201ccome down to earth with a bump\u201d as cut-price rivals Aldi and Lidl continue to apply intense pressure on the sector.\n\nREAD MORE: Aldi rolls out investment plans amid record sales\n\n\u201cA year ago Sainsbury\u2019s was congratulating itself for retaining its middle-class client base while the German discounters decimated their rivals at Tesco and Morrisons,\u201d Ibbotson said.\n\n\u201cNow Tesco and Morrisons have staunched their losses and are fighting back with aggressive price cuts and some fundamental reforms to their structure. By contrast the Sainsbury\u2019s response \u2013 the abolition of multi-buy promotions and the introduction of simpler pricing \u2013 looks distinctly underwhelming in the current brutal market conditions.\u201d\n\nClick here to \u2018Like\u2019 The Scotsman Business on Facebook",

    "title": "Upperclassmen impart wisdom in new Mentor A Peer program",
    "text": "After discovering a need on campus for peer-to-peer mentoring, the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education (VPUE) is piloting a new program called Mentor A Peer (MAP). The program pairs juniors and seniors with freshmen and sophomores, giving upperclassmen the opportunity to share their Stanford experiences with underclassmen.\n\nFor this year\u2019s pilot program, MAP coordinators are looking for 20 upperclassmen mentors and 20 sophomore mentees to jumpstart the mentorship community. The intention is to extend mentee applications to freshmen in future iterations of the program.\n\nDespite the plethora of resources available to underclassmen, including Academic Advising Directors and Pre-Major Advisors, many students still find it difficult to navigate those resources or identify the resources suitable for their needs, according to MAP co-director Isabelle Foster \u201918.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the mentor is what we envisioned as a central hub,\u201d Foster said. \u201cSo upperclassmen will be able to refer underclassmen to different sources and know who the right person to go to is.\u201d\n\nProspective mentors can apply at the start of fall quarter. After being selected, they will undergo a training program in which they will be introduced to all the resources on campus as well as the expectations for the mentoring relationship, according to MAP co-director Alberto Covarrubias \u201918.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for mentors to be a mirror or someone who can help a mentee reflect on their experiences,\u201d Covarrubias said. \u201cWe want [mentors and mentees] to think out loud together to figure out where [mentees] are at and how they\u2019re navigating Stanford.\u201d\n\nAccording to Covarrubias, much of the mentor training will be about developing listening skills and being able to handle all of the situations that can arise in conversation. The goal is for mentors to become facilitators around conversations surrounding academic, social and career advice.\n\n\u201c[The mentor] isn\u2019t meant to be one person who knows it all, but it\u2019s meant to be someone who is familiar with a lot of resources and people with the expertise,\u201d Covarrubias said.\n\nThere are several attractions for upperclassmen to become mentors. The main one includes the chance to \u201cpay forward\u201d all the help they had previously received when they were underclassmen, according to Foster.\n\n\u201cThe mentor will have the opportunity to not only give back to the community by helping a mentee, [but] they will also be able to develop leadership skills, which would be helpful if they want to do a staff position in the future or become more involved on campus,\u201d Foster said.\n\nAfter training in the fall, mentors will be individually matched with their mentees in the beginning of winter quarter. VPUE will also provide a Coupa Cafe gift card for each mentor and mentee pair to encourage the development of a mentoring relationship while having coffee and snacks.\n\nFoster, Covarrubias, along with recent graduates Marisa Messina \u201916 and Joseph Troderman \u201916 were members of last year\u2019s VPUE Student Advisory Group which advises Vice Provost Harry Elam on student issues and interests. According to Covarrubias, \u201cOne of the issues that came up last year was the conversation about mentorship and how important it was for the undergraduate community.\u201d\n\nThe group conducted several Qualtrics surveys and spoke with both underclassmen and upperclassmen in order to gauge the interest in the program.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was that a lot of students wanted peer advice and wanted to talk to students who had gone through the Stanford experience very recently and had taken the same classes and knew what it was like to live in the dorms,\u201d Foster said.\n\nIn some ways, the idea of a peer mentor is modeled after having a resident assistant (RA) who is solely focused on one student.\n\n\u201cWe found that a lot of students loved their RAs, trusted them and felt like they could connect with their RAs,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in taking that concept of the RA and making it more personalized.\u201d\n\nThe applications to become mentors will be released to upperclassmen in the following weeks. Sophomores can apply to become mentees in November.\n\nContact Ariel Liu at aliu15 \u2018at\u2019 stanford.edu.",

    "title": "You\u2019re saying it wrong",
    "text": "I had no intention of watching the debate Monday night (if just because many of the \"facts\" used on both sides would most likely be at least somewhat fact-free)--on my schedule for the night, besides finishing this column, was intense thumb-twiddling (also known as, \"Seriously? Why is this Windows update taking two hours?\") and cat-cuddling. Yep, I really know how to live.\n\nWith politics off the table, this week I turn my attention to another source of frustration and amusement.\n\nSpelling and pronunciation mistakes can sometimes make even the mildest-mannered word nerd into a raging grammar grouch. Say \"new-kew-ler,\" \"real-a-tor,\" or \"joo-la-ree\" around me and at least one recent letter-writer and you'll likely hear a low growl ... if you're lucky.\n\nIf it helps, break up those particular words into separate words. Repeat after me: New-clear. Real-tor. Jewel-ree. Got it? Good.\n\nMy cousin Mary, who just happens to have been my senior English teacher in high school, often greeted mispronunciations in her class with \"Make sure you don't put the em-PHAS-is on the wrong sy-LAB-ble.\" But what about when the actual syllables and letters are ignored?\n\nDon't get me started on Britons and their habit of ignoring whole syllables. In 'Murica, \"Leicester Square\" would probably be pronounced LYE-ches-ter Square instead of the Britons' Less-ter Square.\n\nIt all makes me want to tell people my name is Brenda, spelled Hasenpfeffer.\n\nPhonetic spellings (oddly, \"phonetic\" isn't spelled phonetically) can help sometimes, but more times than not, the ones I see tend to result more in guffaws than comprehension. While checking an online discussion on a British newspaper site last week, I came across \"passafists.\" It took several minutes before I realized that the writer meant \"pacifists,\" and then I couldn't stop giggling at the imagery. I have no idea anymore what the article was or the point the writer was trying to make.\n\nThen there are the place names whose pronunciations vary from place to place--such as El Dorado (long A in Arkansas, and with an \"ah\" in California), Cairo (pretty much like the syrup in Illinois, and with a long I in Egypt) and Lafayette (essentially the original French in Louisiana, but with a long A in Arkansas ... we apparently really like using a long A). And there are the ones that look as if they should be pronounced one way but will quickly tag you as an outsider if you pronounce them as they're spelled. Just try to pronounce Gravette as gra-VETTE in Arkansas and see what happens.\n\nAccording to Grammarly, the English language \"has 44 distinct sounds, with more than 1,000 different ways to spell them! But think of the advantages. English spelling gives fascinating glimpses into the origins of words that retain the pronunciation of their language of origin. ... The English language's odd pronunciation habits add an element of unpredictability, making it an interesting language that keeps learners on their toes.\"\n\nIs it any wonder we're confused? And pity the poor non-native speakers learning English, especially those whose first language is more phonetic (meaning that what a word looks like is pretty much how it's pronounced, and vice versa) and has more consistent phonemes (distinct sounds) than English. Add to that the English language's tendency to appropriate bits of other languages, and it would seem mispronunciation is inevitable.\n\nSome mispronunciations are artifacts of childhood and misreading words we haven't yet heard, such as \"hyperbole\" (hyper-bowl) and \"determined\" (deeter-mined; I remember this one), and never correcting the mispronunciation. When I first saw \"Ouachita\" in print, I thought it was ooh-a-cheetah. I'm a laugh riot at the zoo.\n\nWe easily excuse mispronunciations from kids, probably because we're so busy chuckling at the errors. (April Ham Lincon? Comedy gold, people!) From adults, though, those mispronunciations tend to grate, and we often label the offenders as uneducated or just plain annoying and doing it intentionally to get under our skin.\n\nSometimes, though, it may be a result of dyslexia or central auditory processing disorder (essentially verbal dyslexia)--when your eyes or ears get their signals crossed, it's hard at times to know what the correct pronunciation is.\n\nSo can anything solve our mispronunciation problem? Not much I see, really, other than continuing education.\n\nBut, I hear you say, it's rude to correct people. Sure, it is--in public, and especially if it's a stranger; however, there's nothing stopping a private chat if it's someone you know, and that person can decide to listen--or not.\n\nNow if they listen and continue intentionally mispronouncing words, I'd advise patience ... lots and lots of patience ... and maybe some chocolate.\n\nCome to think of it, I'd advise that with the election, too.\n\n------------v------------\n\nAssistant Editor Brenda Looper is editor of the Voices page.

    "text": "Finance Ministry institutes Fiscal Forecasting Committee\n\nIdentifying and understanding risk is the first step to mitigating it, says Finance Minister, Winston Jordan.\n\nThe economist pointed out that the government embarked on several initiatives within the Ministry of Finance to enhance capacity to conduct economic analysis and to assess risks to continued growth and development.\n\nJordan said that a Macro-Fiscal Forecasting Committee has begun meeting on a monthly basis to discuss the economic outlook of the nation and generate macroeconomic forecasts.\n\nThe Finance Minister said that good forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are an essential input into developing appropriate economic and fiscal policies.\n\nHe said that while there is often a high degree of uncertainty around the point estimates in any economic forecast, a good forecast provides an accurate broad outlook for the economy and highlights the risks and uncertainties that officials should consider when making forward-looking policies.\n\nOver the past year, he said that the Ministry of Finance, with support from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC), has been working to improve its macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting.\n\nHe said that this led to the birth of an interagency Macro-Fiscal Forecasting Committee, which includes representation from the Bureau of Statistics, Bank of Guyana, Guyana Revenue Authority, and multiple divisions within the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for advising on the data, assumptions, and judgments that go into the forecast model. The Committee is chaired by the Director of the Office of the Budget, Sonya Roopnauth and managed by the Economic Policy Analysis Unit within the Office of the Budget, which is also responsible for updating and maintaining the forecast model.\n\nAccording to Minister Jordan, the Macro-Fiscal Forecasting Committee meets on a monthly basis. It held its first meeting on May 20, last. In addition to providing inputs to the forecast model, meetings provide a valuable opportunity for interagency discussion about key risks and challenges for economic growth and development.\n\nIn the future, the Committee will also be responsible for analyzing the error margin on its forecasts and making improvements to the forecast model.\n\nJordan recalled that in November 2015, CARTAC conducted a workshop with staff from the Ministry of Finance, Bank of Guyana, Bureau of Statistics, and Guyana Revenue Authority to develop a model for forecasting key variables in the real and fiscal sectors of the economy, and train staff in the model\u2019s use.\n\nHe said, too, that it was last June that a second workshop was conducted to develop models for the external and monetary sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Finance Minister said that to produce an accurate forecast, the models require high quality data input and subjective judgments from experts in each sector of the economy.",

PHOTO | KENNEDY OKWACH\n\nAs many youth complain about lack of employment, one from Busia County has resorted to agriculture for a living.\n\nSHARE THIS STORY Tweet\n\nBenjamin Ong\u2019aria from Tangakona Village in Busia County ventured into poultry farming to pay his university fees.\n\nToday, the third year Bachelor of Education student at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University has 100 chickens.\n\nMr Ong\u2019aria ventured into the business in 2009 after completing his Diploma in Community Development and Social Work.\n\nThe 31-year-old said that due to years of frustrations and lack of employment, they formed a group for youth empowerment.\n\n\u201cA group of 25 youth came together and formed Spider Development Network. Various groups trained us on different business projects,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy breakthrough came when the Agricultural Sector Development Support Programme (ASDSP) trained us on commercial poultry farming and linked us to Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (KALRO).\u201d\n\nDisappointing start\n\nMr Ong\u2019aria had saved Sh20,000, which he used to build a structure to house the chicks, fencing and buying basic materials like feeders.\n\nA local KALRO distributor gave him 100 chicks which was his starting stock.\n\n\u201cThe distributor was sourcing for market and the profit I made was used to clear a loan while the capital was used to buy new stock and feeds,\u201d said Mr Ong\u2019aria.\n\nDespite a disappointing start where he lost over 300 chicks to diseases that nearly forced him out of farming, he never gave up.\n\nHe now rakes in profits of between Sh30,000 to Sh70,000 per month from selling the chicken which he keeps for two months then disposes. \u201cDue to my inadequate capital, I am unable to satisfy the huge demand for chicken in Busia County,\u201d Mr Ongaria said. He buys the chicks, the improved kienyeji type, at Sh60 each and sells the chicken after two months at Sh300.\n\nHis target market is local farmers who rear the chicken for eggs or meat.",

    "text": "Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf will forfeit unvested equity awards worth about $41 million and will not get a salary while the company\u2019s board investigates the bank\u2019s sales practices.\n\nCarrie Tolstedt, the former head of the retail division at the centre of a burgeoning sales scandal, has left the company ahead of her planned December 31st retirement date, will get no severance and has forfeited unvested equity awards worth about $19 million, the bank said.\n\nMr Stumpf and Ms Tolstedt will also not receive bonuses for 2016. The penalties represent one of the biggest financial sanctions ever levied against a major bank boss and mark a sharp change from a few years ago when despite scandals at large banks, no chief executive had to give back a bonus.\n\nWells Fargo, the US\u2019s third-largest bank by assets, is under pressure to show it is holding its top brass accountable after government investigations revealed that some of its employees opened as many as two million accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge in order to meet sales targets.\n\nThe company\u2019s failure to claw back executive bonuses was a big feature of Mr Stumpf\u2019s appearance before a Senate Bank Committee meeting last week into the bank\u2019s sales tactics. Some politicians also called on him to resign.\n\nMr Stumpf will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. The San Francisco-based bank agreed to pay $190 million earlier this month to settle regulatory charges over the account scandal and has fired about 5,300 employees, most of them low-ranking staff, in connection with it.\n\nA special committee of the bank\u2019s independent directors will lead an investigation into the retail bank\u2019s sales practices, helped by the board\u2019s human resources committee and the law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP, according to the statement. The investigation may lead to further compensation changes or employment actions, the company said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned by these matters, and we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Company\u2019s business are conducted with integrity, transparency, and oversight,\u201d Stephen Sanger, the board\u2019s lead independent director, said in a statement. \u201cWe will conduct this investigation with the diligence it deserves.\u201d Mr Stumpf, a member of the board, has recused himself from the investigation, the bank said. Wall Street banks have introduced clawback provisions in the wake of the financial crisis when tens of billions of dollars in penalties for mortgage fraud and other illegal activities were paid out but no executive had to give back their bonus.\n\nSince then, and before Mr Stumpf\u2019s forfeiture, the closest a bank chief executive has come close to a clawback was when Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, had his 2012 bonus cut in half after the bank\u2019s board decided he should shoulder blame for $6.2 billion of \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading losses.\n\nWells Fargo has previously said it would eliminate sales goals in its retail banking on January 1st, 2017. However, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that the firm was planning to eliminate the goals on October 1st, citing Mr Stumpf\u2019s prepared remarks for delivery at the hearing.\n\nUp to Tuesday\u2019s close, shares of the company have fallen nearly 10 per cent since September 8th when it reached a settlement with regulators, wiping off about $24 billion of market capitalisation.\n\nReuters",

    "text": "NATIONALS\n\nRamos has torn ACL\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Washington Nationals' World Series hopes took a serious blow Tuesday when All-Star catcher Wilson Ramos was diagnosed with a torn ACL in his right knee.\n\nRamos is out for the rest of the season, including the playoffs, taking one of the most consistent power bats out of Washington's lineup. He was hitting .307 with 22 home runs and 80 RBI and was one of baseball's best offensive catchers.\n\nManager Dusty Baker said Ramos will soon have surgery to repair the ligament, which he tore during an awkward landing while catching a relay throw Monday night. It's the same knee Ramos had two surgeries on in 2012 to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament.\n\nThe injury is a double blow for Ramos given the proximity of the postseason and that he's set to become a free agent after the World Series.\n\n\"There's never an opportune time,\" Baker said. \"This was the most inopportune time for this to happen.\"\n\nThe NL East champions will go with a combination of Pedro Severino and Jose Lobaton behind the plate in Ramos' absence. They called up Spencer Kieboom as a third catcher earlier Tuesday.\n\nROYALS\n\nGee out with clots\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Right-hander Dillon Gee has two blood clots and will not pitch again this season for the Kansas City Royals.\n\nGee was the winning pitcher Sunday at Detroit, but was hospitalized after the game. He returned Tuesday to Kansas City.\n\nManager Ned Yost said Gee has a blood clot in one of his lungs and a shoulder.\n\nGee, 30, was shut down in July 2012 while with the New York Mets with a blood clot in his right shoulder that required surgery.\n\nMETS\n\nMatz' surgery set\n\nMIAMI -- New York Mets left-hander Steven Matz will undergo surgery next week to remove bone spurs in his pitching elbow and will miss the rest of the season.\n\nMatz, who has not pitched since Aug. 14, is expected to be ready for spring training.\n\nThe news Tuesday before the Mets' game at Miami was the latest blow for a team riddled this year by injuries but still in contention for an NL wild-card berth.\n\nMatz's availability for the postseason had already been doubtful because he has been sidelined for more than a month because of tightness in his left shoulder.\n\nMatz finishes the year 9-8 with a 3.40 ERA in 22 starts.\n\nBLUE JAYS\n\nBenoit tears calf\n\nTORONTO -- Toronto Blue Jays reliever Joaquin Benoit is expected to miss the rest of the regular season after tearing his left calf muscle when he tripped and fell while running in from the bullpen during one of two benches-clearing incidents in Monday's 7-5 loss to the New York Yankees.\n\nSecond baseman Devon Travis will not play the opener of Tuesday's pivotal series against Baltimore after he jammed his surgically repaired left shoulder in the second incident against the Yankees. Travis left Monday after aggravating the injury during his next at-bat.\n\nToronto added right-hander Chris Smith and infielder Andy Burns to its roster. Both finished the minor league season with Class AAA Buffalo.\n\nBenoit has been a reliable setup man since a July 26 trade with Seattle, going 2-0 with a 0.38 ERA and 24 strikeouts in 232/3 innings.\n\nToronto leads the wild-card race, one game ahead of Baltimore.\n\nMARLINS\n\nPrado signs extension\n\nMIAMI -- Third baseman Martin Prado, who tossed baseballs to kids at the completion of every half inning, has agreed to terms on a three-year, $40 million contract extension to remain with the Marlins.\n\nPrado, 32, was eligible for free agency after the season.\n\nRegarded as a clubhouse leader and tough competitor, the signing of Prado was a priority for the Marlins heading into the offseason.\n\nAn 11-year major league veteran, Prado is hitting .305 this season with 7 home runs and 73 RBI.\n\nThe Marlins acquired Prado and pitcher David Phelps in a December 2014 trade with the New York Yankees in exchange for pitcher Nathan Eovaldi.\n\nRANGERS\n\nDarvish's brother convicted\n\nTOKYO -- A Japanese court on Tuesday convicted the brother of Texas Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish of gambling on baseball games, handing him a suspended prison sentence.\n\nThe Osaka District Court found Sho Darvish guilty of taking hundreds of bets on Major League Baseball and on professional baseball games in Japan last year.\n\nThe court said the 27-year-old younger brother of Yu Darvish was sentenced to two years and four months in prison, but it was suspended for five years. The court said the defendant's gambling was limited to his group of friends and was not linked to organized crime, according to local media reports.\n\nThe younger Darvish took bets of 10,000 yen ($100) on Japanese and American professional baseball games, accepting wagers totaling about 110 million yen ($1.1 million) through the LINE social networking application, Kyodo News reported.\n\nSho Darvish himself bet roughly 220 million yen ($2.2 million) on the games, Kyodo said.\n\nHis arrest last year led to an investigation of his brother, Yu Darvish, but authorities found no involvement by the Rangers star.\n\nSports on 09/28/2016",

    "text": "Senate discusses Full Moon on the Quad report in first meeting of school year\n\nIn their first meeting of the current school year, the 18th Undergraduate Senate announced an upcoming University report on Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ) and debated a resolution on a Santa Clara County public transportation measure.\n\nSenators also gave routine reports on their personal projects and heard funding requests from the Stanford Gaming Society and the International Justice Mission at Stanford.\n\nFMOTQ working group report slated for Thursday release\n\nSenate Chair Shanta Katipamula \u201919 and Senator Carson Smith \u201919 announced that the working group report on FMOTQ would be released on Thursday.\n\nThe working group was formed after student outcry at news that the Office for Student Affairs was considering whether to defund FMOTQ. In March, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman had written a letter to the student body president and vice-president that cast doubt over the administration\u2019s future support for the event.\n\nBoth the Senate and the student body protested at the move itself as well as the perceived lack of student input, with a student referendum showing 88.55 percent support for continued University sponsorship for FMOTQ. In response, the University convened a working group consisting of student, faculty and staff representatives to discuss the future of FMOTQ.\n\nSmith, as the Senate representative on the working group, expressed her satisfaction with the process and the outcome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely happy with the result and how we were able to bring people together from a variety of different areas on campus,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile she could not discuss the content of the report, she stressed that the students on the panel were included in the discussion.\n\nDebating Measure B and the Senate\u2019s role\n\nCarl Guardino, who serves as President and CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, presented his organization\u2019s proposal to improve transportation in Santa Clara County during the meeting. Guardino was seeking a Senate resolution in support of the so-called Measure B, which Santa Clara County voters will vote on in a Nov. 8 ballot.\n\nMeasures included extending the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system to better serve lower-income communities such as East San Jose, as well as building level boarding platforms at Caltrain stations for passengers with physical disabilities.\n\nWhile Senators largely agreed that the measure was a step forward for the county, they worried that supporting an external political cause might violate the ASSU constitution.\n\nSenator Junwon Park \u201919 commented, \u201cI personally appreciate and wholeheartedly support the measures to increase the safety of drivers here and in the community around us.\u201d\n\nHowever, Park went on to question whether the measure could be said to \u201cdirectly [affect] Stanford students,\u201d a condition stipulated in Article I, Section 5B of the ASSU constitution.\n\nSenators TG Sido \u201918 and Khaled Aounallah \u201919 raised students, faculty and staff members who commute to campus as examples to show that the student body \u2014 and by extension, the Senate \u2014 should indeed be concerned with the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Hattie Gawande \u201918 argued that the debate on constitutionality was skirting the core issue of the Senate\u2019s role as the representative of the student body.\n\n\u201cI think that a lot of the squeamishness about the measure is less about any special affection we have for the constitution,\u201d Gawande said. \u201c[It\u2019s] more of us using the constitution to justify the fact that we\u2019re uncomfortable with this is new role we\u2019re taking on\u2026 to encourage the student body to be involved in electoral politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we as a Senate got into the role of encouraging students to do the right thing, it seems like a good role to me,\u201d she concluded to applause from fellow Senators.\n\nThe Senate agreed to reopen their conversation on the measure at their next meeting.\n\nContact Fangzhou Liu at fzliu96 \u2018at\u2019 stanford.edu.",

The statement did not say whether Fernandez had been drinking or what time he left.\n\nThe bar is along the Miami River in the city's downtown section and allows boats to dock alongside.\n\nFernandez, 24, died when the boat he owned slammed at high speed into a rock jetty early Sunday just off South Beach, investigators say. Emilio Jesus Macias, 27, and 25-year-old Eduardo Rivero also died.\n\nA friend of Rivero's, Will Bernal, said they texted each other shortly after midnight, before the three pushed off. Bernal posted the messages on social media.\n\n\"Yo please be careful bro,\" Bernal texted at 12:07 a.m.\n\n\"I will bro,\" Rivero said.\n\n\"Try to keep him close to shore if you go out,\" Bernal wrote back.\n\n\"Trust me,\" Rivero wrote, \"it's not my time yet.\"\n\nBernal then asked Rivero to turn on his \"find iPhone\" application and to \"keep Jose cool.\"\n\nOzuna, perhaps Fernandez's closest friend on the team, said all of the players knew Fernandez planned to go out on the boat that night.\n\n\"It was a bad decision for him,\" Ozuna said. \"He heard everybody say, 'No, go back to your house and take it easy.' Then you wake up and see the news.\"\n\nFernandez apparently had concerns he might be late to the ballpark for Sunday's 1:10 p.m. game, because he asked Ozuna for a wake-up call.\n\n\"He said, 'If I'm not here by 10, call me,'\" Ozuna said.\n\nThe Marlins announced a public viewing will be held Wednesday at a Miami church, preceded by a funeral procession scheduled to start at 2:16 p.m. outside the team's downtown ballpark. Fernandez wore No. 16 on his jersey.\n\nA private funeral will be held Thursday for the Fernandez family and Marlins players and personnel.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is investigating. Spokesman Rob Klepper said in an interview Tuesday that there's no timetable, and \"we will provide a complete and thorough investigative report.\"\n\nThe 32-foot boat named \"Kaught Looking\" -- the \"K\" is backwards, signifying a strikeout when the batter does not swing -- will be thoroughly checked for clues as to why the accident occurred, authorities said. Miami-Dade County prosecutors have obtained search warrants for wildlife commission investigators seeking access to the vessel, said Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the state attorney's office.\n\n\"As you know, FWC has a duty to investigate fatal boating accidents like this one,\" Griffith said in an email. \"Since the incident involved a single boat and there were no survivors, there can be no criminal prosecution derived from the FWC investigation.\"\n\nKlepper said the wildlife commission has no record of any previous citation or warning involving the boat, Fernandez or the other two men who died. Normally vessel stops are not documented unless a warning or citation is issued, he added.\n\nThe Miami-Dade County medical examiner has not yet released toxicology results that might determine if Fernandez or the other two victims were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Klepper said that report would be part of the wildlife commission's completed investigation. Authorities previously said no evidence of alcohol or drugs was found at the crash scene.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Florida's U.S. senators, Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Marco Rubio, introduced a resolution Tuesday honoring Fernandez for his journey from communist Cuba to Major League Baseball stardom and his contributions to the community.\n\nThe resolution notes that Fernandez was jailed in Cuba after an unsuccessful attempt to defect and once saved his mother from drowning after she fell from a boat off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.\n\n\"He risked his life escaping tyranny in Cuba to seek liberty and opportunity in America,\" Rubio, also a Cuban-American, said in a news release.\n\nMeanwhile, a beachgoer found a bag containing four baseballs signed by the Marlins pitcher, WSVN-TV reported.\n\nThe station reported a black bag containing Jose Fernandez's checkbook and four autographed baseballs apparently washed ashore on Miami Beach not far from the accident site.\n\nOcean Rescue Division Chief Vincent Canosa said the bag was given to a lifeguard and that it apparently came from the boat.\n\nEnormously popular in Miami's large Cuban-American community, Fernandez defected from Cuba at age 15, won the National League Rookie of the Year award in 2013 and became a two-time All-Star. He had been scheduled to pitch Monday night against the New York Mets, a game that instead became a tribute to him and remembrance of his life.\n\nSports on 09/28/2016",

    "title": "Rolls-Royce boss must deliver following restructuring",
    "text": "Rolls-Royce boss Warren East has rebuilt confidence in the British engine-maker, but there are doubts among investors and industry experts about whether his slimmed-down group has the muscle to meet ambitious production and development goals.\n\nThe CEO has axed more than 600 management jobs and sought to reduce production times and costs since taking the helm last July, as part of a drive to increase efficiency at a company traditionally viewed as a symbol of British engineering might.\n\nWhile wrestling with the restructuring, however, Rolls must almost double its output of wide-body plane engines by 2019 to meet orders. It must also replace the blades across hundreds of engines used in Dreamliners after some cracked, while designing two new jet engines, the Advance and UltraFan.\n\nA source in the company familiar with its strategy told Reuters that East\u2019s turnaround programme was being felt across the business. It has eliminated 33 internal legal entities out of about 300, allowing it to cut down on back office support and internal transactions, the source said.\n\nThere has also been progress on the factory floor, according to the source. At one plant in Washington, northeast England, he said Rolls had cut the time it takes to manufacture the fan and turbine discs used in its engines by 50 per cent, by combining production processes and introducing robotics and faster inspection processes.\n\nEast has also been shaking up the senior executive team tasked with turning around the aerospace and defence company, naming Daily Mail and General Trust\u2019s Stephen Daintith as its new finance chief last week.\n\nThe company also told Reuters that it has appointed mergers and acquisitions banker Ben Story as director of strategy and marketing and Neil Crockett, a former veteran of Cisco Systems Inc, as chief digital officer.\n\nHis overhaul has buoyed the company\u2019s stock, along with the impact of the fall in the pound against the dollar after the Brexit vote, which makes Rolls engines cheaper for overseas buyers. Rolls-Royce shares are up 25 per cent this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut even some of its most supportive investors concede that, while the restructuring - which included axing a fifth of senior management jobs - might stand Rolls in good stead in the long term, it could pose problems over the next five years.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of uncertainties out there. And if you focus on those, it could be a pretty bumpy ride,\u201d said senior portfolio manager Kave Sigaroudinia at Baillie Gifford, Rolls\u2019s fourth-biggest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\n\u201cYou will get operational challenges, ramping up production can create operational problems,\u201d Sigaroudinia told Reuters.\n\nA spokesman for Rolls-Royce, which issued a string of profit warnings last year, said the company was focused on making the business simpler and more efficient.\n\n\u201cWe can continue to be focused on our transformation, even while we increase engine production and invest in the new technologies that will create the next generation of Rolls-Royce civil aerospace engines,\u201d he added.\n\nExecution\n\nAnalysts expressed deeper concerns about the company, whose shares trade at a price to earnings ratio of 27 for 2016, compared with a sector average of in the mid-teens. That comes despite an expected halving of profits this year and no recovery to 2015\u2019s profit level in sight for the next three years.\n\nOf 24 analysts covering the stock, only two rate it a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or a \u201cbuy\u201d, while its current 711 pence share price trades well above the consensus 627 pence target price, according to Reuters data.\n\n\u201cRolls looks to be priced almost for a flawless execution,\u201d said Barclays analyst Phil Buller, who has an underweight rating on the stock with a target price of 480 pence.\n\nEast (54) is one of the most celebrated technology executives in Britain, having built ARM into the country\u2019s most successful tech company in the 12 years he was CEO.\n\nBut flawless execution is particularly hard to come by in the aviation industry, where the giant nature of projects mean they are regularly subject to cost-overruns and delays.\n\nAt the same time as almost doubling its wide-body jet engine output, Rolls is looking at squeezing more out of its Trent XWB engine for the Airbus A350 engine by enhancing it for a potential, bigger 400-seat model of the plane, as Airbus and Boeing play leapfrog in the market for twinjets.\n\nAny problem with the availability of parts - and there are over 20,000 in each Trent XWB - or issues with quality could delay the ramp up programme.\n\nIt is also developing a derivative of the Trent 1000 for another Airbus jet, the A330neo. That is on top of the new Advance and UltraFan engines for wide-body jets - to be ready for service in 2020 and 2025 respectively.\n\n\u201cThe CEO acknowledged that existing engineering resources are \u2018stretched\u2019 against this set of programmes,\u201d Bernstein analysts said after East participated in their conference this month.\n\n\u201cBut he feels confident that better process management will enable Rolls-Royce to complete these on time without reverting to adding significant headcount or facing material cost overruns.\u201d\n\nSetbacks\n\nThe aerospace industry is full of examples of projects suffering setbacks, including the delays experienced by Boeing on its 787 Dreamliner, which entered service three years late, and Airbus on its A380 project, less than two years late.\n\nMost recently, US aero-engine maker Pratt & Whitney in September downgraded its 2016 delivery forecast for the engines which power the Airbus A320neo, a miss which it said would put pressure on its cash flow.\n\nA problem on one of Rolls\u2019s flagship Trent 1000 engines, used to power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is testament to what can go wrong.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nANA Holdings, Japan\u2019s largest airline, said in August that all 100 Rolls-Royce engines on its Dreamliner fleet would need modifying following three engine failures caused by corrosion and cracking of turbine blades.\n\nNow, Rolls-Royce must set about replacing blades across all its Trent 1000s, of which there are hundreds. Boeing says that of the 445 Dreamliners in operation worldwide, about 40 per cent use the Rolls-Royce engines.\n\nOn top of all the other production and development challenges facing Rolls, this left the company looking like its hands were full, according to an industry source.\n\n\u201cBoeing is likely to be asking Rolls-Royce some questions about how intensely they are going to be focused on supporting the 787 issue,\u201d the source said.\n\nAny slip-ups may make it harder to convince Boeing it has the capacity to take part in the US planemaker\u2019s next likely project: a mid-market jet requiring a new engine that could cost $5 billion to $6 billion to develop.\n\nGE and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to compete for the mid-market project.\n\nFor investors like Baillie Gifford, and US activist investor ValueAct, which took a stake in Rolls last year based on what it sees from 2020 onwards, the company\u2019s long-term outlook holds potential.\n\n\u201cWe always take it back to the long-term view, what we have seen over the last six months is incrementally positive news,\u201d said Baillie Gifford\u2019s Sigaroudinia. \u201cYou can have a stab at what it is going to look like in 10-15 years time because these programmes are so long term, and that is where our bold case comes from.\u201d\n\nSome other shareholders are more cautious.\n\nRichard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management - which holds a 0.3 per cent position in Rolls in its passively managed funds - said the concrete results of East\u2019s work were a long way off.\n\n\u201cEast is very well respected, but it remains to be seen if his turnaround plans can improve the transparency and predictability of the company.\u201d",

    "text": "The state Plant Board will decide Friday whether to accept a committee recommendation to further restrict the use next growing season of certain herbicides after some farmers this year illegally sprayed the weedkiller dicamba and damaged or ruined their neighbors' crops.\n\nArkansas agriculture experts had predicted that the summer mash-up between farmers and a new seed technology from Monsanto would cause problems.\n\nMonsanto, the St. Louis-based seed conglomerate, began selling two versions of its new soybean seeds last spring: Xtend, which is dicamba tolerant, and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, which is tolerant of both dicamba and glyphosate, a herbicide commonly known as Roundup. Monsanto released the new seeds before the federal Environmental Protection Agency had approved an accompanying herbicide called Xtendimax VaporGrip, a dicamba formulation that Monsanto says is less susceptible to drift, and Roundup Xtend VaporGrip, a pre-mix of glyphosate and dicamba.\n\n\"[B]y not having a dicamba labeled for use [with the new seeds], we are most likely headed for a train wreck,\" Tom Barber, a weed specialist for the UA system extension service, wrote in his blog Feb. 3, well before planting time. \"This is disturbing because never in the past has other herbicide-tolerant technology been released without the herbicide being labeled for use in the crop.\"\n\nTo battle Roundup resistant pigweed infestations, some farmers planting the new seeds sprayed available formulations of dicamba. That caused damage to crops planted with earlier-generation seeds and vegetation sensitive to dicamba. Because certain formulations of dicamba are highly volatile and likely to drift, it's illegal to spray the herbicide across soybean and cotton fields once the plants have emerged.\n\nTwenty-five complaints were filed in July with the Plant Board by farmers against farmers after finding cotton and soybeans with damage consistent with being hit by dicamba. Those complaints are still being investigated. Many other farmers reported damage but chose to not file complaints.\n\nThe EPA said last month that it is investigating dicamba complaints in 10 states: Arkansas, Missouri, Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The EPA noted that Missouri reported 125 complaints affecting some 40,000 crop acres, mostly in four counties that make up that state's \"bootheel,\" just across the state line from several northeast Arkansas counties.\n\nThe extent of damage to soybean, cotton and fruit crops won't be known until after harvest. Of Arkansas' 25 complaints, 13 came from just two counties: Craighead and Mississippi.\n\nThe proposals\n\nTo help prevent dicamba-drift damage next year, the Plant Board on Friday is scheduled to consider:\n\n\u2022 Banning the use of dicamba herbicides of dimethylamine (DMA) salt and acid formulations, except on pastures, but only if all susceptible crops are at least 1 mile away in all directions.\n\n\u2022 Prohibiting the spraying of dicamba composed of diglycolamine (DGA) salt and sodium salt from April 15 through Sept. 15 -- five key months of the growing season -- except on pastures or rangeland, again with a 1-mile buffer.\n\n\u2022 Requiring farmers who use a salt dicamba called Engenia, by BASF, on Xtend cotton and soybeans to have a quarter-mile downwind buffer zone and 100-foot buffer in all other directions. Research by the University of Arkansas System's Agriculture Division has shown that Engenia is less volatile than other salt dicambas.\n\n\u2022 Requiring anyone who uses any of the DGA-based herbicides on genetically modified seed by Dow Chemical Co. or Monsanto to be trained and certified through a program to be determined.\n\nThe first proposed Plant Board restriction -- the banning of DMA salt of dicamba -- affects the most readily available, and least expensive, herbicides on the market. DMA salt of dicamba also is considered to be among the most volatile herbicides, especially on warm, humid days when the chemical can vaporize and spread to other fields. None of those herbicides was made by Monsanto.\n\nThe second proposal -- banning DGA dicamba on fields after April 15 -- would affect Monsanto's herbicides M1691 and the two VaporGrip formulations, none of which have been approved yet by the EPA. \"That proposal will really limit growers' access to technology that they need today,\" Boyd Carey, Monsanto's lead representative for crop-protection systems in North America, said Friday.\n\nThe fourth restriction affects Monsanto's Extend cotton and soybean crops because it puts Xtend growers into a certification program, at their own expense, before they can use herbicides not yet approved by the EPA. \"We have robust training in place, and we'll work with the Plant Board in seeing that training continues,\" Carey said. \"But if VaporGrip is limited or banned in the state, it will completely eliminate a tool that farmers need.\"\n\nThe Plant Board's pesticide committee, which also handles herbicides, met five times since the dicamba outbreak before coming up with its recommendations.\n\n'Yield, yield and yield'\n\nIf and when Monsanto's new herbicides are approved by the EPA, there's no guarantee their use will be allowed in Arkansas.\n\nThe Plant Board has been consistent in its desire that chemical companies allow UA weed scientists to study herbicides -- a process that the scientists say will take at least two years. Monsanto hasn't allowed any other third-party studies, citing proprietary reasons. Instead, Monsanto said it has 33 farmers conducting field tests in North Carolina, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota.\n\nThe UA weed scientists announced early this year that, in a greenhouse study, they found that pigweed began growing resistant even to dicamba after just three generations of exposure.\n\n\"One pesticide quits working and so we replace it with another, and so on and so on, until you are left with a weed population or insects, for that matter, that can tolerate multiple modes of action,\" said Bob Scott, another UA weed scientist. \"This is the inevitable result of using a single effective mode of action to control a given pest.\"\n\nMonsanto critics say the company never should have sold, or been allowed by regulators to sell, the new seed without having the accompanying herbicide available.\n\nFord Baldwin of Stuttgart, a farm consultant and former UA weed scientist, said farmers who sprayed dicamba illegally should have known better but placed special blame on Monsanto. \"The seed side has not made full eye contact with the weed-science side of the genetics,\" Baldwin told state regulators during a hearing July 25. \"Mainly from the seed side you hear 'yield, yield and yield.'\"\n\nBaldwin said he hasn't seen proof yet of Monsanto's assurances of higher yields with its Xtend beans. \"They certainly will out-yield any other soybeans that are injured by dicamba,\" he said then. \"The marketing model appears to be 'we are committed to this technology, we have all this seed, we are going to sell this seed and anything happening after that is someone else's problem.' Companies simply must assume more ownership in the herbicide side of the seed. Weed control and the ability to manage the herbicide will ultimately drive the choice of seed.\"\n\nDanny Finch of Jonesboro, a member of the Plant Board representing cotton farmers, accused Monsanto of essentially forcing farmers to buy their seeds.\n\nMonsanto representatives pushed back. \"We're not forcing anyone to plant them,\" a Monsanto lawyer said.\n\n\"You're not giving them any options. They're going to plant them for defense,\" Finch said, referring to farmers who buy dicamba-tolerant Xtend beans only because a neighbor did.\n\nAnother Monsanto representative said the company worked hard to tell Xtend buyers not to use dicamba.\n\nBut, upon questioning from Finch, the Monsanto representative said it has no plans to take action against those who planted the Xtend seeds and sprayed dicamba illegally.\n\n'Extreme measures'\n\nMonsanto told investors in August that it had sold 1 million acres of Xtend soybeans this year, with expectations of selling 15 million acres in 2017 and 55 million by 2019.\n\nBaldwin warned that row-crop farmers aren't the only ones with something at stake, noting dicamba damage to fields of watermelons, cantaloupes and peanuts, peach orchards, cultivated broadleaf vegetation and trees, including oaks, sycamores, and the Bradford pear. \"The issue could easily get outside of agriculture, and that could be a game changer,\" he said.\n\nFarmers who planted Xtend crops had a choice: spray dicamba illegally, fight a likely ineffective battle against battle-tested pigweed using Roundup or other herbicides, or disk up their fields.\n\nThe fine for illegally spraying dicamba is $1,000; losing an entire field could cost many times that.\n\nPerry Galloway of Gregory in Woodruff County was the state's top soybean grower last year with a yield of 108.76 bushels per acre. This year he plowed up 150 acres of Roundup Ready soybeans overrun by pigweed.\n\nHe replanted the acreage with LibertyLink soybeans, and the fields have been clean. But the late in-season replanting will cost him about 30 bushels an acre, Galloway said Friday.\n\nHe doesn't believe in a ban of any formulations of dicamba and said the Plant Board shouldn't take any \"extreme measures.\"\n\n\"We need all the technology we can get because we are out of bullets against pigweed,\" Galloway said.\n\nWhile the Plant Board grapples with pesticide regulations, another of its committees has recommended increasing the fine from $1,000 for illegally spraying dicamba to $25,000. Any such increase cannot be applied retroactively and must be approved by the General Assembly.\n\nCharlie Fleeman, a farmer in Manila in Mississippi County, recently estimated he had 200 acres of soybeans damaged.\n\nFleeman won't know how much the dicamba cut his yield for a few more weeks. \"Every farmer around me has complained about all this to some extent,\" Fleeman said.\n\nThe $25,000 fine, if approved, \"certainly would make a farmer think twice\" about improperly using dicamba again, he said.\n\nThe Plant Board's approval of the herbicide restrictions will not put them automatically into place.\n\nA public hearing, likely in November or December, and another vote of the board would be necessary. If approved then, the recommendations would go to the governor for his approval and then to the Legislative Council, lawmakers who conduct the Legislature's business when it is not in session.\n\n\"If he [Gov. Asa Hutchinson] declines, we're back at square one,\" Terry Walker, director of the Plant Board, said after the pesticide panel made its herbicide recommendations Sept. 14. \"At that point, I don't know,\" he said.\n\nThe upshot of the pesticide committee's work doesn't alter one central fact: Spraying dicamba over the top of crops is illegal, Walker said.\n\n\"Illegal is illegal,\" Walker said. \"You can't prevent it unless you outright ban the entire product.\"\n\nBusiness on 09/28/2016",

Bald Knob was third with a 332.\n\nBismarck was led by Carlye Norris, who shot 90 and finished fourth in the individual standings.\n\nMadison Hinds finished with a 107 for 11th place and Esther Filipek was 13th with a 110.\n\n\"This was obviously a team effort and I am proud of their performances today,\" said Bismarck Coach Tony Hardage, who is in his ninth year with the program. \"Two seniors and two freshmen made up the four and they all did their job today.

    "text": "A Rothschild family insider claims the global elite are actively fomenting a race war in America in order to advance the agenda of depopulation, destroy the black race, destabilize the nation, and create the conditions necessary for martial law and global governance of the U.S.\n\nAs if following a script or some explicit stage direction by a greater power, the narrative of racism and division is being pushed by mainstream media, and the idea of an American race war is becoming less far fetched every day.\n\nNo one among the ranks of the citizenry stands to gain anything at all from a blood bath between blacks and whites, but here in 2016, we suddenly find ourselves on the precipice of such an apocalyptic clash.\n\nWho benefits?\n\nWakingtimes reports:\n\nIn 2013 James Casbolt, aka Michael Prince, a self-proclaimed Rothschild family insider explained to Kerry Cassidy of Project Camelot how the world political elite were planning to catalyze a race war in America as part of a conspiracy to advance the agenda of depopulation, to destroy the black race, to further destabilize the nation, and to create the conditions necessary for martial law in the U.S.\n\nCasbolt claims to be part of the Rothschild bloodline, someone who has spent his entire life being groomed as an assassin for the world\u2019s most powerful family, a Super Soldier as he puts it. Now serving time in prison, some consider Casbolt\u2019s credentials to be rather shady, however in many interviews on the subject of the world\u2019s ruling elite he has presented insight and information that bears out as being both well-informed and shockingly prescient.\n\nIn this case, he was asked by Cassidy, again over three years ago, what he thought the global elite were planning in order to expand their empire of control in coming years. His reply seems almost prophetic today against the backdrop of riots in several major U.S. cities and the emergence of the George Soros funded fifth column revolution movement, Black Lives Matter (BLM).\n\nCasbolt\u2019s reply:\n\n\u201cThe enemy now is, they\u2019re instigating a race war in America. They\u2019re socially engineering it, a race war against blacks and whites because they\u2019re trying to reduce the population so they\u2019re targeting blacks in America as the first group. And it\u2019s an extension of what was going on in Africa with them depopulating the blacks in Africa with engineered AIDS and things like that. So they\u2019re engineering social situations in America now, and that group is being currently targeted, you know the blacks in America.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of race issues being brought into the media, like Obama\u2019s talking about, \u2018let\u2019s talk about race.\u2018 In the media a lot of things are focused on race to get people\u2019s mindsets geared up for that.\u201d ~ Michael Prince\n\nSocial engineering programs are the chief export of the global elite, as history demonstrates. Casbolt goes on to connect contemporary events to events in the sixties when the CIA is known to have infiltrated the counter-culture movements working against the establishment war machine.\n\n\u201cIn essence it\u2019s a continuation of social engineering programs from Haight Ashbury in the sixties in San Francisco. You know, the Manson family, the Charles Manson murders, and he was programmed at China Lake, for that, for the social engineering. He, Charles Manson was talking about Helter Skelter, which is a race war, an apocalyptic race war in America between blacks and whites, and the Beatles triggered that, the Helter Skelter song, and then that was, the Manson murders were supposed to trigger that, and that was, the race war was supposed to start in Haight Ashbury, the hippie colony in San Francisco.\n\nThey\u2019ve often tried to, with the Fourth Reich being based on the West coast, they\u2019ve tried to trigger this Helter Skelter apocalyptic race war in California. With the L.A. riots they tried to do it again, and they\u2019re going to keep trying to do it until all hell breaks loose between blacks and whites in America, because\u2026 the black race is being targeted currently in America, the African-American.\u201d ~ Michael Prince\n\nReferring to a faction of the ruling elite as the Fourth Reich, a living continuation of the Nazi movement that destroyed Europe in the 1940\u2019s, Casbolt speaks of an engineered race war as key component in the plan to depopulate the planet.\n\n\u201cThe Fourth Reich essentially is going to keep socially engineering these situations, you know like the Helter Skelter or the Manson in the sixties, the L.A. riots, things will keep happening, because they want to reduce the population, but they need to start with target groups.\u201d ~ Michael Prince\n\nThree years after this interview, as this exact scenario inches ever closer, comments such as these should serve as warnings that we are being tricked into participating in our own demise, and as the mainstream media twists real events and injustices into a false flag race war, we must counter the divide and conquer strategy with a popular campaign of unity while identifying and calling out the true global forces playing us all like puppets.",

    "text": "One despicable group\n\nOkay, so Hillary has her basket of deplorables. Therefore, I am entitled to my basket of despicables: the entire Obama gang; the Clintons; NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, NPR, the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc.; the Republican establishment \"leadership\"; the National Democratic Party; Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Elizabeth Warren, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; the Hollywood liberal establishment; and any liberal who promised the black community anything for their vote for the past 50 years but gave them nothing.\n\nFeel free to make your own additions.\n\nBERNARD A. FRAZER\n\nNorth Little Rock\n\nGuess what: She's evil\n\nI would like to add to the growing cacophony concerning the evilness of Hillary Clinton's evil plan for evil of the evil kind. Her evil began when she was born in 1947 in Chicago, as people may still talk of a gathering darkness the night of her birth that portended evilness, and of a raging storm that night followed by a drought the following day (or some other evil meteorological event).\n\nHer evil was first manifested when, as a girl, she enjoyed pulling the wings off fly larvae. Later her Rodham evil was intensified when it was merged with the Clinton evil that was further distilled into an evil 180-proof evil brew that she intends to pour into the gagging throats of metaphor-challenged Americans.\n\nThen there are the \"missing\" emails, the contents of some of which I discovered in this very letter. They detail her previous agreement to allow evil aliens called Vogons to destroy the Earth to make room for a hyperspace bypass. I have found proof of this plot from scientist Douglas Adams in a book I once read titled either The Approaching Evil or something else. I plan to further expose the evil of Hillary's evil in my forthcoming book, the publication of which will be mysteriously suppressed.\n\nMeanwhile, I look forward with dread to the Nov. 8 epic battle between The Great Evil and The Great Bombast, followed by the destruction of Earth mentioned above and Hillary's replacing Satan as the ruler of Hades.\n\nED CHESS\n\nLittle Rock\n\nNot shortage answer\n\nRe \"Shortage solution\" guest column: Lower the bar for teacher licensure? Dumbing down the teachers leads to dumber students, who become dumber adults happy with dumb, low-salaried jobs offered by the company that pays to promote charter schools. These schools can pay teachers less because they are not as well-trained or qualified, increasing their profit margin at the expense of public schools that used to be the backbone of our democracy.\n\nMURIEL LEDERMAN\n\nLittle Rock\n\nSolution to disrespect\n\nTo stop all the whining about spoiled, overpaid NFL athletes and the national anthem, I have a simple solution. Play the national anthem while the teams are in the locker room before the game.\n\nPlayers can \"disrespect\" each other all they want in the privacy of their playpen, and the fans won't care.\n\nBOB L. WARNER\n\nHot Springs Village\n\nHuffing and puffing\n\nThe Benghazi-gate hurricane scare has blown itself out, but email-gate and Clinton Foundation-gate keep churning in the Sea of Cynicism and Gullibility, fed by Republican huffing and puffing. They too will soon be manifested only in the condensation on Republican jowls.\n\nThe Hillary they love to hate is their creation. So, ironically, is the Trump they hate to love.\n\n\"What could possibly go wrong?\" a spouse, or maybe former House Speaker John Boehner, might have asked, sarcastically, as Republicans in Congress received orders for unrelenting Obama-thrashing, and, as occasions arose, Hillary-bashing.\n\nTheir pitch now is that both candidates are terrible, but at least Trump is one of \"us.\" That works best if one covers one's ears and goes to one's happy place in one's mind.\n\nYou can safely ignore the rattling metal sheets of thunder, flashing bulbs of lightning, and the wind and rain machines. I believe Hillary Clinton has an excellent record as a genuine, accomplished, highly qualified, honest, trustworthy and patriotic citizen and public servant. Hillary understands the complex challenges America faces today. She doesn't offer pat solutions, but she has the vision, intelligence and experience to do what needs doing. She will be a good president, maybe even great, depending on how she handles the great challenges.\n\nPatriotic Republicans in Congress will find willing partners in Clinton and Democratic colleagues to tackle the great challenges. We could all be great together--again.\n\n\"That would be different,\" a spouse, or John Boehner, might say, sarcastically.\n\nHOWELL MEDDERS\n\nFayetteville\n\nNothing in life is free\n\nBernie Sanders advocates for some noble causes such as \"free\" college education, a $15 minimum wage, a single-payer health-care system. These are appealing, especially to younger citizens. Regretfully, that same age group is going to experience a shock when the reality hits that nothing is free.\n\nThey will be paying for benefits such as these for a long time. The federal debt is already unsustainable at nearly $20 trillion. It will be much greater by the time (assuming our country still exists) that these young people have to start paying down the debt caused by the many types of benefits that already exist.\n\nRICHARD HARRIS\n\nConway\n\nEditorial on 09/28/2016",

    "text": "Saxophone, food and drink against a 22 MW turbine backdrop\n\n200 people celebrated the opening of the Gadegast wind farm with the vortex energy team\n\n(PresseBox) - Under clear skies, mayor Peter M\u00fcller and the vortex energy group's wind team met with all the companies involved in the construction to celebrate successful commissioning together with over 200 guests. Among them were property owners, who have been supporting the project now for almost four years, as well as interested residents from the surrounding communities of Gadegast, Zallmsdorf, Naundorf, Mellnitz, Leetza, K\u00fclso and Dietrichsdorf.\n\nConstruction of the Gadegast wind farm began at the end of March this year and was successfully completed in September. \"I would like to thank system manufacturer GE, our site manager Dirk Kleemann from Zetcon, the Max B\u00f6gl construction company, the power grid company Mitnetz and the company Global Energy from Stettin as well as the investment team from Prime Capital. The teamwork on this project was exemplary and allowed vortex energy's team to quickly implement the Gadegast wind farm in just seven months. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back\", says Dr. Florian Leuthold, Board Member and Managing Director of vortex energy Deutschland GmbH, in his welcoming speech. Christian Banzer then opened the buffet. As the Managing Director of Prime Capital, he represented the wind farm investor, a German insurance company, in all the phases of project acquisition.\n\nGE 2.75 MW wind energy systems with a total height of 199 meters were constructed. Each of the systems has an electrical output of 2.75 MW. The hub height is 139 meters, and the rotor diameter is 120 meters. Five of eight systems are already feeding power into the regional grid. The rest of them will be started by the end of the month, thus providing a total of 16,000 households with green energy.\n\nThis project placed special emphasis on communication and transparency in order to promote acceptance among the local population. From the outset, citizens were involved in the project via personal talks and regular project newsletters. At the opening ceremony, project brochures also provided an overview of the project ? from acquiring all environmental certifications and approval according to the Federal Immission Control Act (BImSchG) to the first steps of laying the foundation.\n\n\n\nSaxophonist Phunky Phil ensured the perfect atmosphere and Ingrid Neubert from the restaurant \"Zum Wiesengrund\" provided tasty regional cuisine.\n\nAfter construction is before construction\n\nStarting at the end of 2012, vortex energy Deutschland GmbH developed, planned and implemented Gadegast wind farm. Following commissioning, it remains closely tied to the Zahna-Elster district. Vortex energy will be responsible for technical management of the wind energy systems as well as carrying out numerous environmental compensation measures to maintain the natural environment. The vortex energy group has implemented 18 wind farms with a total capacity of 366 MW in Germany and Poland. The next wind project \"Felsberg\" is already in the starting blocks in the home region of Northern Hesse. Construction starts in October 2016. A total of six Nordex N-131/3000 systems with an installed capacity of 3 MW each and total output of 18 MW will be commissioned in 2017. Special features of this project include its forest location and implementation of a communal wind energy system.\n\n\n\n\n\nPressRelease by\n\nvortex energy holding ag\n\nCompany information / Profile:\n\nDate: 09/28/2016 - 07:12\n\nLanguage: English\n\nNews-ID 497459\n\nCharacter count: 3487\n\nKontakt-Informationen:\n\nFirma: vortex energy holding ag\n\nStadt: Zahna-Elster\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of hits: 62\n\n\n\nLinking-Tips:\n\n\n\nDirect Link to this PressRelease:\n\n\n\n\n\nTwittern\n\n\n\nWe would appreciate a link in your News-, Press- or Partner-Site.\n\nComments on this PressRelease",

    "title": "'Best' talk motivates Euro team",
    "text": "CHASKA, Minn. -- Davis Love III said he was only trying to illustrate why his United States team should play with more swagger in the Ryder Cup. His comments wound up providing plenty of fodder for the Europeans, and perhaps a little extra motivation they didn't even need.\n\nThe catch phrase for this Ryder Cup: \"Best golf team maybe ever assembled.\"\n\nThat's what Love said in a radio interview last week. Rory McIlroy seized on it last weekend, joking that the Americans at least had the best Ryder Cup Task Force ever assembled. He couldn't help but mention it again on Tuesday before the first practice session at Hazeltine.\n\n\"Whenever we are going up against one of the greatest teams ever assembled, that's motivation enough,\" McIlroy said.\n\nAdding to the bulletin-board material was NBC Sports analyst Johnny Miller saying Europe had the worst team he had seen in years, particularly with six rookies.\n\nThe record shows otherwise.\n\nEurope has won eight of the past 10 times in the Ryder Cup dating to 1995, and while there are six players who have never experienced the emotions and pressure of the Ryder Cup, only four Europeans on the team know the feeling of losing.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you don't win the Ryder Cups with your mouth,\" Sergio Garcia said. \"You win them out there on the golf course. So that's what we'll see, which team is the best.\"\n\nLove said the conversation on SiriusXM Radio last Friday was \"misconstrued.\" He said a Canadian caller had said the Americans needed to play with more swagger, and Love agreed with him. He said the host asked what he would tell his team.\n\n\"And I said: 'I would tell my team they're the best team ever assembled. Let's go out and show off and play and have fun,' \" Love said.\n\nIt didn't quite come out that way.\n\nLove said on the radio show that Americans have been guilty of playing not to lose, and that they need to smash the tee shot, walk quickly to the golf ball and \"let the other team know that we are going to dominate you.\" He talked about having confidence and how the Americans didn't need to do anything \"super human.\"\n\n\"This is a great team,\" he said. \"This is the best golf team maybe ever assembled.\"\n\nEuropean captain Darren Clarke said he didn't need to post anything on the walls of the team room. His players heard the comment, some of them laughed about it, none appear to have forgotten. Clarke seemed more defensive about Miller's comments.\n\n\"We have the Masters champion [Danny Willet], we have the [British] Open champion [Henrik Stenson], we have the Olympic champion [Justin Rose] and we have the FedEx champion [McIlroy]. You combine that with all the experience and with all of the rest of the team and the way those guys played, I don't really need to respond to that,\" Clarke said. \"I think I've got full confidence in our team.\"\n\nBased on the how Europe practiced Tuesday, it appears that Clarke is blending experience with rookies. He had Martin Kaymer and Lee Westwood with rookies Rafa Cabrera Bello and Willett; Stenson and Rose with rookies Matt Fitzpatrick and Thomas Pieters; and McIlroy and Garcia with rookies Chris Wood and Andy Sullivan.\n\nThe Americans are back to their \"pod\" system that Paul Azinger used in a rare victory in 2008 and Love modified in 2012. Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar were in one group; Phil Mickelson, Zach Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker were in another. Both groups featured previous partnerships. The last group included the lone rookies -- Ryan Moore and Brooks Koepka -- with J.B. Holmes and Brandt Snedeker.\n\nNeither side really needs any motivation, though Spieth suggested the most powerful type.\n\n\"We're tired of being told we haven't won,\" he said.\n\nLove said he brought Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, to speak to his team on Monday night. Clarke countered with Paul O'Connell, the recently retired Irish rugby star. The message Clarke wants to deliver this week is for Europe to stand shoulder to shoulder.\n\nLove had the Americans on the verge of victory at Medinah, leading 10-6 going into the final session until they were overwhelmed by Europe and lost again. Only five players were on that 2012 team -- Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Zach Johnson, Snedeker and Kuchar.\n\n\"We've got a different team, and that's what I keep telling this team,\" Love said. \"Don't look to the past. This team has never played together before. This team has no history. They are a great team.\"\n\nBest ever assembled? He won't know that until someone is holding the gold cup on Sunday.\n\nSports on 09/28/2016",

    "text": "FAYETTEVILLE -- Alcorn State's visit to Little Rock Saturday to play No. 20 Arkansas looks to fall in a good spot for the Braves considering it's between the Razorbacks' first two SEC games against No. 9 Texas A&M and No. 1 Alabama.\n\nThe possible edge for the Braves (1-2) is that the Razorbacks (3-1) still could be trying to get over their 45-24 loss to the Aggies or looking ahead to playing the Crimson Tide and dismiss an opponent that plays on the Football Championship Subdivision level, where programs can not exceed 63 scholarships as to 85 at the FBS level.\n\nAlcorn State Coach Fred McNair doesn't necessarily buy into the theory the Razorbacks won't be focused on playing his team.\n\n\"Maybe it's a good time to play them before they play Alabama, but they're going to keep their tools sharp,\" McNair said. \"They're going to come out and play.\n\n\"I don't think the coaches are going to let them just take the day off.\"\n\nThe Braves have won back-to-back Southwestern Athletic Conference Championships, going 10-3 in 2014 and 9-4 in 2015 under Coach Jay Hopson, who is now at Southern Mississippi.\n\nMcNair, the Braves' offensive coordinator the previous four seasons, was promoted to replace Hopson.\n\nAlcorn State was picked to win the SWAC Eastern Division in a preseason poll, but the Braves have lost to Arkansas-Pine Bluff 45-43 in triple overtime and 43-18 at Grambling State after opening with a 21-18 victory over Alabama State.\n\nBraves junior quarterback Lenorris Footman, a returning starter, didn't play against UAPB because of an ankle injury. He replaced redshirt freshman Noah Johnson -- the starting quarterback the last two games -- in the second quarter at Grambling State, but was \"hopping around\" on his ankle according to McNair.\n\nFootman completed 11 of 20 passes for 137 yards with 1 interception against Grambling State. Johnson completed 8 of 17 passes for 65 yards and 1 touchdown.\n\nMcNair put Footman in the game after Johnson lost 16 yards scrambling -- with the Braves having second and 10 at the Tigers 20 -- and fumbled with Grambling State recovering.\n\nMcNair said Johnson played well against UAPB, but struggled last week.\n\n\"That's just being a freshman and not spending much time in there,\" McNair said. \"Hopefully, we'll get Lenorris healthy and he'll come back and make this run.\"\n\nJohnson has completed 43 of 69 passes for 483 yards and 4 touchdowns without an interception and rushed 29 times for 128 yards and 4 touchdowns. Footman has completed 16 of 32 passes for 199 yards with 1 interception and rushed 9 times for 39 yards.\n\nThe Braves' top two rushers are juniors Arron Baker (25 carries for 176 yards) and De'Lance Turner (36 for 138). Senior Jaborian McKenzie has a team-leading 21 receptions for 226 yards.\n\nSenior linebacker Darien Anderson has 30 tackles, including 6\u00bd sacks for 42 yards in losses.\n\nKenyon Brantley, a senior from Crossett, is a starting defensive tackle.\n\n\"It'll be big for him to go back home,\" McNair said. \"He's excited about playing Arkansas.\n\n\"He's a senior and he knows what to expect. He's been there before and played in some big games.\"\n\nThe Braves, who are reportedly receiving a $575,000 guarantee for the game, are hoping for a better outcome than their last game against a nationally-ranked FBS team, when they opened with a 69-6 loss at No. 18 Georgia Tech last season.\n\n\"The biggest thing is trying to go and play our brand of football,\" McNair said. \"Play the whole game instead of one half.\n\n\"We're just still plugging away, man, trying to get these guys to jell together.\"\n\nFour FCS teams have beaten opponents from Power 5 conferences this season with North Dakota State winning at Iowa 23-21, Richmond winning at Virginia 37-20, Northern Iowa winning at Iowa State 25-20 and Eastern Washington winning at Washington State 45-42.\n\nArkansas suffered one the most notable upsets at the hands of an FCS team when The Citadel beat the Razorbacks 10-3 to open the 1992 season, resulting in Jack Crowe being fired as head coach.\n\n\"Upsets happen all the time,\" McNair said. \"That's the thing we've got to hone in on -- make our guys understand it can happen.\n\n\"We just have to believe in what we can do as a football team right now. If we do that, I think we'll be OK going into this game.\"\n\nMcNair was asked what needs to happen for the Braves to have a shot to beat Arkansas.\n\n\"We have to play our A-plus game on offense, special teams and defense, and things have to go our way,\" he said. \"Then we have to hope they make mistakes on the other side and we can capitalize on those.\n\n\"That's the way it's going to have to be this weekend.\"\n\nSports on 09/28/2016",

    "text": "Rugby is all about manipulating defenders to discover space.\n\nTake that flawlessly executed try up in Scotstoun last Friday. Iain Henderson is sin-binned for flinging Tommy Seymour on the ground so Glasgow have a numerical advantage for a 15th minute scrum just inside Ulster territory.\n\nRob Herring\u2019s heavy heal squirts ball out the back but an instinctive player like Ruan Pienaar can make this work to his advantage. Paddy Jackson is already switching from right to left, coming from the Ulster 10 metre line towards the short side.\n\nJared Payne is tracking Jackson. Stuart Olding runs the out-to-in decoy line to hold the drift defence.\n\nFatally, Glasgow outhalf Finn Russell takes two steps forwards that breaks the defensive chain. Entering the land of no return for a defender, Russell has now lost the collision and ends up clinging to Payne\u2019s hip.\n\nThe Ireland fullback is running laterally as he strides past Russell but straightens to offer Charles Piutau a one v one with Leonardo Sarto.\n\nSarto, the 30-cap Italian international, seems to have Piutau trapped between himself and the left touchline. But to compensate for Russell, he\u2019s looking inwards at Payne way too long.\n\nSarto, flat-footed and reaching with his arms so neutralising his power base, grabs thin air as Piutau accelerates away.\n\nA huge side step embarrasses prospective Lions fullback Stuart Hogg.\n\nAs Piutau enters the Glasgow 22 four men are dragged into his orbit.\n\nUntouched, and in his own good time, the offload allows the supporting Pienaar glide further infield.\n\nEight pair of hands later and Darren Cave dives over in the right corner. Payne has not been idle; he\u2019s the penultimate ball carrier, taking seven rapid strides to fix the cover.\n\nThis is the sort of decision making that wins tight matches\n\nIt\u2019s the type of try Payne and Piutau grew up scoring. So did I. Just not as often.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhere Russell and Sarto fell down was they defended as individuals and not a pair.\n\nBoth Sarto and Russell are looking at Jackson to see what he does.\n\nSarto\u2019s body shape is all wrong so he\u2019s unaware of Piutau\u2019s looming shadow.\n\nA brilliant flash of evasive footwork is still needed to break free but, equally, it highlights the importance of being shown how to defend correctly at an early age.\n\nNow, if I had played all my early rugby at Wexford Wanderers rather than Clongowes Wood I might still have got capped for Ireland. Just nowhere near 83 test matches.\n\nThe IRFU are seeking to improve coaching for teenagers across Ireland, in clubs and less traditional rugby areas, to ensure the naturally gifted player is armed with the tools needed to survive later on.\n\nPienaar probably played some cricket in South Africa but himself and Piutau were so obviously reared with a rugby ball stuffed under their arm. I\u2019ve seen Kilkenny teenagers with that same head-swivelling, awareness of space to compliment their skill-set. Hurlers with thousands of hours pucking sliotars back and forth or against a wall on their own.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the same volume of rugby players to produce Richie Hogans and TJ Reids. A Luke Fitzgerald comes along every now and again. The Byrne twins. Joey Carbery.\n\nI\u2019ve moved away from the theory that mixing up lots of sport growing up in Ireland is a benefit when it comes to being a professional rugby player. Gaelic games are not really transferable. What are the specific benefits? Catching ball overhead is about it.\n\nName me the Gaelic footballers who became rugby players? Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe, not really. Nor was Robbie Henshaw. All good footballers, sure, but those lads were more rugby players who played GAA. Darren Sweetnam is a hurler who, like Tom\u00e1s O\u2019Leary, has made the switch from Cork underage hurling to Munster.\n\nBut it takes years.\n\nI hurled from the age of six to 12. Same time Piutau was learning to ghost past Scottish fullbacks. Give me 20y minutes against a wall and I\u2019ll rediscover my touch. But hurling never really helped my rugby. Took many, many hours away from it, in fact.\n\nSix years of boarding school helped my rugby.\n\nEven shifting from outhalf to wing in December of fourth year slowed my development. It was decided the senior cup team would benefit from turning me into a finisher. That\u2019s three crucial years where I was scoring tries instead of honing the essential skills needed to create them.\n\nI was moved because Bobby Quigley came in at scrumhalf with Ciaran Finane switched to outhalf. Both were quality passers. We reached a final with Bobby and Ciaran as primary decision makers as I was exiled to the back field, where I remained for eight years until an Australian coach figured I was a centre.\n\nMaybe the multi-sports approach or denying natural talent a creative role, with the primary focus being to win above all else, is stunting the growth of Irish rugby.\n\nThen again some things can\u2019t be coached. Hogg will have nightmares about Piutau.\n\nThere is a flip side to this argument.\n\nPaddy Jackson is rightly getting plaudits for Ulster\u2019s winning start to the season. He is playing well but not enough to challenge for Johnny Sexton\u2019s Ireland jersey. Not yet anyway.\n\nThe best example of this is Johnny orchestrating and creating Josh van der Flier\u2019s second try against the Ospreys on Friday night.\n\nWhen Johnny is on the field everything goes through him. Arguably too much.\n\nWhat has Ulster clicking at the moment is the key players who surround Paddy. With Leinster, more often than not, Johnny is first receiver.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLike Rog and Jonny Wilkinson before him, Sexton likes to call the shots for the entire 80 minutes. I can tell you that not too many decisions are made by the inside centre playing alongside these three outhalves.\n\nWhereas for Ulster several players have licence to create. Louis Ludik slots in there regularly and their attacking momentum goes unchecked.\n\nPayne, Stuart Olding, Stu McCloskey, Luke Marshall are all comfortable first receivers and more importantly good distributors. The benefit is the attacking pattern continues if Paddy is clearing a ruck.\n\nThere is no right or wrong here but it explains why almost every team seek to take Sexton out with a cheap shot. No other Leinster or Irish player regularly runs the strike moves. Chop off the head mentality.\n\nRugby is all about creating mismatches and exploiting them.\n\nManipulating space. Piutau and Payne are experts but Pienaar is the master; an invaluable resource that Irish rugby is about to lose against Ulster\u2019s and Pienaar\u2019s will.\n\nWhat a shame that a man who wants to stay and raise his family in Belfast, who has embraced the club and driven the culture, cannot be allowed finish his career at Ravenhill.\n\nUlster are adamant they can afford to keep him. Because he is an priceless commodity; the type of rugby player who coaches merely by togging out for training.\n\nThe IRFU see it otherwise. The theory behind denying Pienaar a new contract is unsound. It makes no sense on any level except a point of principle. Ulster will have to recruit another scrumhalf, probably from abroad, to remain competitive next season.\n\nThis seems desperately short sighted.\n\nWe won\u2019t never see a player with the Springbok\u2019s poise for a very long time. Next season Ulster will have four, maybe five scrumhalves on their books - two are Leinster spares - who have yet to show the requisite abilities to challenge for international honours.\n\nWhat Pienaar concocted in the 38th minute against Glasgow - literally something from nothing - will be lost.\n\nThe Ulster pack is back-pedalling just outside their 22. Pienaar clearly shapes to box kick. Pressure should be on the scrumhalf to clear his lines yet keep the ball in play. Most Irish nines, perhaps all of them, would have blinkers on. One option. Shoulders are parallel, backside facing touchline, the stance of a certain box kick.\n\nWith a quick glance over his shoulder Pienaar changes the shape of the game. He wheels around and pops the ball to Cave.\n\nPiutau fends off the hapless Hogg and is away again. This is the sort of decision making that wins tight matches against clubs like Toulon or Saracens.\n\nLet\u2019s say a Conor Murray type of player, God knows they are rare on this island, is in the Ulster Academy right now. He is 19 and could be alongside Ruan every day for the next three years. Asking questions.\n\nWhy did you do that? How do you kick like that? Why do you always kick to the bottom right hand corner?\n\nThat sort of intergenerational knowledge could turn the next Conor Murray into the best scrumhalf in the world. Instead Pienaar will be gone and that teenager will not learn from this technically world class operator.\n\nNext season\u2019s starting Ulster scrumhalf will have to sink or swim.\n\nWhat if he sinks in Europe? Ulster lose is what.\n\nWorst case scenario is it ruins a scrumhalf who could have had a long career because he gets exposed too soon to a standard he is not ready for.\n\nGetting rid of a guy like Pienaar without a replacement feels like a decision that will prove more detrimental to Irish rugby than its progressive intent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt also means the time for Ulster to deliver is now. Is their tight five good enough to win a Pro 12? The jury is still out. Rory Best will make a massive difference and Marcell Coetzee\u2019s return to fitness might allow Henderson shift from flanker to lock.\n\nBut Friday was a serious victory. Winning in Glasgow for the first time lays down a clear marker for the season ahead.\n\nAnd there was a joy in how they manipulated all those defenders to discover all that space.",

    "title": "Tribal service deals could help Dakota pipeline impasse: Whiting CEO",
    "text": "Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, waits to give his speech against the Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access oil pipeline during the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland September 20, 2016. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nProtesters demonstrate against the Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, in Los Angeles, California, September 13, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File photo\n\nSAN FRANCISCO The chief executive of North Dakota's largest oil producer, Whiting Petroleum Corp, says the standoff over the $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline could be solved by giving economic opportunities, including supply and delivery contracts, to the Standing Rock Sioux and other Native Americans.\n\nThousands of protesters from all over the world have joined with the Sioux to oppose the pipeline, which would transport oil within half a mile of tribal land in North Dakota. Federal regulators temporarily blocked construction of the pipeline earlier this month under the Missouri River, mollifying opponents but irking the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux say the pipeline's construction would destroy tribal burial sites. They also worry that any future leaks would pollute their water supply.\n\nJim Volker, Whiting's CEO, said those concerns would be best addressed through economic opportunities, including contracting with American Indian-owned firms for water hauling and other oilfield service needs across oil-producing regions.\n\n\"We as an industry like to see them provide those services,\" Volker said in an interview on the sidelines of the Independent Petroleum Association of America's OGIS conference in San Francisco.\n\n\"It does provide a better standard of living for them. It does provide a direct tie to the energy business and makes them and their tribal leaders more inclined to want to have more energy development.\"\n\nWhen fully connected to existing lines, the 1,100-mile (1,770 km) pipeline would be the first to carry crude oil from the Bakken shale directly to the U.S. Gulf. The project is being built by the Dakota Access subsidiary of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP.\n\nContracts between Native American-owned firms and oil and natural gas producers are not uncommon on reservations. Indeed, the MHA Nation, whose members live on a reservation in western North Dakota where about a third of the state's crude is pumped, requires oil producers operating on their land to contract with American Indian-owned businesses.\n\nBut the requirement cannot apply outside the reservation's borders and many oil companies, Whiting included, do not have oilfield service and supply contracts with a large number of Indian-owned firms.\n\nDave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, said he appreciated the suggestion from Volker, but that his opposition to the pipeline has little to do with economics.\n\n\"It's going to be very difficult for us to allow this line to come through just because some indigenous-owned company may benefit,\" Archambault said in an interview. \"If this pipeline goes through, we will be the first to pay the cost.\"\n\nDakota Access first contacted the Sioux about the pipeline in October 2014 and continued reaching out to the tribe through March 2016, according to a report from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nVolker, who has worked at Whiting for more than 30 years, said he was sensitive to the tribe's concerns that construction of the Dakota Access pipeline would disturb ancestral burial sites and other historical areas.\n\n\"I wouldn't want necessarily a pipeline to go through the cemetery where all my relatives are buried,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that he expects the situation to be resolved by November. \"I'm pretty sure there will be a pretty good resolution to this.\"\n\nVolker called a move last week by the owners of the Dakota Access pipeline to buy more than 6,000 acres of land adjacent to the line's route a \"pretty good move.\" Federal oil pipeline regulators do not have authority over private land and cannot block construction on it.\n\n\"It just increases the odds that things get done,\" he said.\n\nThe Dakota Access pipeline would, if finished, help North Dakota oil producers transport their product to refiners and other customers cheaper and faster.\n\nVolker said he estimates the pipeline would cut the differential for North Dakota oil - that is, the extra cost needed to get the oil to market due to its distance - from about $8.50 per barrel to around $5.50.\n\nFederal regulators are expected to rule soon on whether the pipeline's construction can proceed, though the Standing Rock Sioux and environmental groups have vowed to oppose it.\n\n(Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

    "text": "By AFP\n\nMore by this Author\n\nPlayboy magazine, once famous for bunnies and soft porn, for the first time is featuring a Muslim woman wearing a hijab, in a spread that is drawing both praise and criticism.\n\nAmerican journalist Noor Tagouri appears in the magazine's October \"Renegades\" edition, a series that focuses on men and women \"who risked it all \u2014 even their lives \u2014 to do what they love.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old journalist who works as a reporter for Newsy, a video news network, is featured wearing a black leather jacket, jeans, sneakers and a hijab, or headscarf, in the publication that describes her as \"a badass activist.\"\n\nTagouri, who is of Libyan descent and whose goal is to become the first \"hijabi\" anchor on commercial US television, says that her struggles as a Muslim woman growing up in the United States have helped her move ahead in her career.\n\n\"I know what it's like to have the narrative of our community be skewed and exploited in the media,\" she told Playboy, which did away with nudity earlier this year as it sought to appeal to a wider audience.\n\n\"I was like, 'Hey, I know what it's like to be misrepresented in the media.

Police have said Scott had a handgun when they approached him at an apartment complex last week.\n\nOfficers told Scott repeatedly to drop the weapon and he was shot to death when he didn't follow their orders, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney has said.\n\nScott's family has said he was not armed. Videos released by police and the family are inconclusive, and state authorities are investigating. Protests over the shooting spanned the past week, and some of those protests turned violent. Charlotte streets were mostly quiet Tuesday night for the first time since the shooting.\n\nTuesday evening, the police headquarters building had to be evacuated as a bomb squad checked out a suspicious package. A robot removed the package from the building and police said on their Twitter page that the package was taken to a remote location to be rendered harmless.\n\nIn the restraining order last fall, Rakeyia Scott sought to keep her husband away because \"he hit my 8-year-old in the head a total of three times with his fist,\" she said in the restraining order.\n\n\"He kicked me and threaten to kill us last night with his gun,\" she said in the order filed in Gaston County, where the couple then lived. \"He said he is a 'killer' and we should know that.\"\n\nRakeyia Scott checked boxes on the form informing law officers who would serve the restraining order that her husband had neither a permit issued by a county sheriff to buy a handgun nor a state permit to carry a concealed handgun, which requires a criminal background check. She said he worked as a mall security guard.\n\nWhen deputies went to serve the restraining order two days after it was filed, Scott had already moved to South Carolina, where he has family. About a week after that, Rakeyia Scott filed a separate court notice voluntarily dismissing the order, saying: \"He is no longer a threat to me and my family.\"\n\nIn a video released last week capturing the moments before and after Scott was shot by police, Rakeyia Scott can be heard telling officers: \"Don't shoot him! He has no weapon.\"\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police said they found Scott's DNA and fingerprints on a handgun recovered at the scene and that he was wearing an ankle holster when he was killed.\n\nPolice released a photo of a small, black handgun they said was recovered from the scene of Scott's shooting on Sept. 20. Police have not described the gun in detail, but printing on the side of the barrel said it was a Colt Series 80 Mustang .380 calibre , which shoots a 9mm bullet, according to Steven Howard, a firearms consultant in Lansing, Michigan, who has testified as an expert witness in court cases.",

    "text": "Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf will forfeit unvested equity awards worth about $41 million and will not get a salary while the company\u2019s board investigates the bank\u2019s sales practices.\n\nCarrie Tolstedt, the former head of the retail division at the centre of a burgeoning sales scandal, has left the company ahead of her planned December 31st retirement date, will get no severance and has forfeited unvested equity awards worth about $19 million, the bank said.\n\nMr Stumpf and Ms Tolstedt will also not receive bonuses for 2016. The penalties represent one of the biggest financial sanctions ever levied against a major bank boss and mark a sharp change from a few years ago when despite scandals at large banks, no chief executive had to give back a bonus.\n\nWells Fargo, the US\u2019s third-largest bank by assets, is under pressure to show it is holding its top brass accountable after government investigations revealed that some of its employees opened as many as two million accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge in order to meet sales targets.\n\nThe company\u2019s failure to claw back executive bonuses was a big feature of Mr Stumpf\u2019s appearance before a Senate Bank Committee meeting last week into the bank\u2019s sales tactics. Some politicians also called on him to resign.\n\nMr Stumpf will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. The San Francisco-based bank agreed to pay $190 million earlier this month to settle regulatory charges over the account scandal and has fired about 5,300 employees, most of them low-ranking staff, in connection with it.\n\nA special committee of the bank\u2019s independent directors will lead an investigation into the retail bank\u2019s sales practices, helped by the board\u2019s human resources committee and the law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP, according to the statement. The investigation may lead to further compensation changes or employment actions, the company said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned by these matters, and we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Company\u2019s business are conducted with integrity, transparency, and oversight,\u201d Stephen Sanger, the board\u2019s lead independent director, said in a statement. \u201cWe will conduct this investigation with the diligence it deserves.\u201d Mr Stumpf, a member of the board, has recused himself from the investigation, the bank said. Wall Street banks have introduced clawback provisions in the wake of the financial crisis when tens of billions of dollars in penalties for mortgage fraud and other illegal activities were paid out but no executive had to give back their bonus.\n\nSince then, and before Mr Stumpf\u2019s forfeiture, the closest a bank chief executive has come close to a clawback was when Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, had his 2012 bonus cut in half after the bank\u2019s board decided he should shoulder blame for $6.2 billion of \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading losses.\n\nWells Fargo has previously said it would eliminate sales goals in its retail banking on January 1st, 2017. However, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that the firm was planning to eliminate the goals on October 1st, citing Mr Stumpf\u2019s prepared remarks for delivery at the hearing.\n\nUp to Tuesday\u2019s close, shares of the company have fallen nearly 10 per cent since September 8th when it reached a settlement with regulators, wiping off about $24 billion of market capitalisation.\n\nReuters",

    "title": "Rolls-Royce boss must deliver following restructuring",
    "text": "Rolls-Royce boss Warren East has rebuilt confidence in the British engine-maker, but there are doubts among investors and industry experts about whether his slimmed-down group has the muscle to meet ambitious production and development goals.\n\nThe CEO has axed more than 600 management jobs and sought to reduce production times and costs since taking the helm last July, as part of a drive to increase efficiency at a company traditionally viewed as a symbol of British engineering might.\n\nWhile wrestling with the restructuring, however, Rolls must almost double its output of wide-body plane engines by 2019 to meet orders. It must also replace the blades across hundreds of engines used in Dreamliners after some cracked, while designing two new jet engines, the Advance and UltraFan.\n\nA source in the company familiar with its strategy told Reuters that East\u2019s turnaround programme was being felt across the business. It has eliminated 33 internal legal entities out of about 300, allowing it to cut down on back office support and internal transactions, the source said.\n\nThere has also been progress on the factory floor, according to the source. At one plant in Washington, northeast England, he said Rolls had cut the time it takes to manufacture the fan and turbine discs used in its engines by 50 per cent, by combining production processes and introducing robotics and faster inspection processes.\n\nEast has also been shaking up the senior executive team tasked with turning around the aerospace and defence company, naming Daily Mail and General Trust\u2019s Stephen Daintith as its new finance chief last week.\n\nThe company also told Reuters that it has appointed mergers and acquisitions banker Ben Story as director of strategy and marketing and Neil Crockett, a former veteran of Cisco Systems Inc, as chief digital officer.\n\nHis overhaul has buoyed the company\u2019s stock, along with the impact of the fall in the pound against the dollar after the Brexit vote, which makes Rolls engines cheaper for overseas buyers. Rolls-Royce shares are up 25 per cent this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut even some of its most supportive investors concede that, while the restructuring - which included axing a fifth of senior management jobs - might stand Rolls in good stead in the long term, it could pose problems over the next five years.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of uncertainties out there. And if you focus on those, it could be a pretty bumpy ride,\u201d said senior portfolio manager Kave Sigaroudinia at Baillie Gifford, Rolls\u2019s fourth-biggest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\n\u201cYou will get operational challenges, ramping up production can create operational problems,\u201d Sigaroudinia told Reuters.\n\nA spokesman for Rolls-Royce, which issued a string of profit warnings last year, said the company was focused on making the business simpler and more efficient.\n\n\u201cWe can continue to be focused on our transformation, even while we increase engine production and invest in the new technologies that will create the next generation of Rolls-Royce civil aerospace engines,\u201d he added.\n\nExecution\n\nAnalysts expressed deeper concerns about the company, whose shares trade at a price to earnings ratio of 27 for 2016, compared with a sector average of in the mid-teens. That comes despite an expected halving of profits this year and no recovery to 2015\u2019s profit level in sight for the next three years.\n\nOf 24 analysts covering the stock, only two rate it a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or a \u201cbuy\u201d, while its current 711 pence share price trades well above the consensus 627 pence target price, according to Reuters data.\n\n\u201cRolls looks to be priced almost for a flawless execution,\u201d said Barclays analyst Phil Buller, who has an underweight rating on the stock with a target price of 480 pence.\n\nEast (54) is one of the most celebrated technology executives in Britain, having built ARM into the country\u2019s most successful tech company in the 12 years he was CEO.\n\nBut flawless execution is particularly hard to come by in the aviation industry, where the giant nature of projects mean they are regularly subject to cost-overruns and delays.\n\nAt the same time as almost doubling its wide-body jet engine output, Rolls is looking at squeezing more out of its Trent XWB engine for the Airbus A350 engine by enhancing it for a potential, bigger 400-seat model of the plane, as Airbus and Boeing play leapfrog in the market for twinjets.\n\nAny problem with the availability of parts - and there are over 20,000 in each Trent XWB - or issues with quality could delay the ramp up programme.\n\nIt is also developing a derivative of the Trent 1000 for another Airbus jet, the A330neo. That is on top of the new Advance and UltraFan engines for wide-body jets - to be ready for service in 2020 and 2025 respectively.\n\n\u201cThe CEO acknowledged that existing engineering resources are \u2018stretched\u2019 against this set of programmes,\u201d Bernstein analysts said after East participated in their conference this month.\n\n\u201cBut he feels confident that better process management will enable Rolls-Royce to complete these on time without reverting to adding significant headcount or facing material cost overruns.\u201d\n\nSetbacks\n\nThe aerospace industry is full of examples of projects suffering setbacks, including the delays experienced by Boeing on its 787 Dreamliner, which entered service three years late, and Airbus on its A380 project, less than two years late.\n\nMost recently, US aero-engine maker Pratt & Whitney in September downgraded its 2016 delivery forecast for the engines which power the Airbus A320neo, a miss which it said would put pressure on its cash flow.\n\nA problem on one of Rolls\u2019s flagship Trent 1000 engines, used to power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is testament to what can go wrong.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nANA Holdings, Japan\u2019s largest airline, said in August that all 100 Rolls-Royce engines on its Dreamliner fleet would need modifying following three engine failures caused by corrosion and cracking of turbine blades.\n\nNow, Rolls-Royce must set about replacing blades across all its Trent 1000s, of which there are hundreds. Boeing says that of the 445 Dreamliners in operation worldwide, about 40 per cent use the Rolls-Royce engines.\n\nOn top of all the other production and development challenges facing Rolls, this left the company looking like its hands were full, according to an industry source.\n\n\u201cBoeing is likely to be asking Rolls-Royce some questions about how intensely they are going to be focused on supporting the 787 issue,\u201d the source said.\n\nAny slip-ups may make it harder to convince Boeing it has the capacity to take part in the US planemaker\u2019s next likely project: a mid-market jet requiring a new engine that could cost $5 billion to $6 billion to develop.\n\nGE and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to compete for the mid-market project.\n\nFor investors like Baillie Gifford, and US activist investor ValueAct, which took a stake in Rolls last year based on what it sees from 2020 onwards, the company\u2019s long-term outlook holds potential.\n\n\u201cWe always take it back to the long-term view, what we have seen over the last six months is incrementally positive news,\u201d said Baillie Gifford\u2019s Sigaroudinia. \u201cYou can have a stab at what it is going to look like in 10-15 years time because these programmes are so long term, and that is where our bold case comes from.\u201d\n\nSome other shareholders are more cautious.\n\nRichard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management - which holds a 0.3 per cent position in Rolls in its passively managed funds - said the concrete results of East\u2019s work were a long way off.\n\n\u201cEast is very well respected, but it remains to be seen if his turnaround plans can improve the transparency and predictability of the company.\u201d",

    "text": "By ERIC MATARA\n\nMore by this Author\n\nFor 18 years, 52,000 retired teachers have been pursuing the release of Sh42.3 billion salaries and pension arrears from the government.\n\nThe retired teachers have expressed optimism that their court battle will come to an end if High Court Judge Justice David Maraga is appointed Kenya\u2019s next Chief Justice.\n\nNine years ago, sitting at the Nakuru High Court then as the presiding judge, Justice Maraga awarded the retired teachers Sh40 billion following a nine-year battle.\n\nThe ruling became the foundation of a vicious court battle after the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) appealed against it.\n\nThe retired teachers sued the TSC for a lump sum payment from the 1997 increment.\n\nThis was one of the landmark judgements that Justice Maraga is celebrated for, even though the government is yet to pay the teachers.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a judgement in December 2015 upholding the ruling.\n\nIf appointed, Justice Maraga will be coming into office as the Judiciary boss when the matter is still pending in the corridors of justice.\n\nThe aggrieved teachers have expressed hope that their long wait might now come to an end following the judge\u2019s nomination to the helm of the Judiciary.\n\nThe initial amount awarded has been accruing interest at the rate of 14 per cent per annum since the initial judgement made by Mr Maraga in 2008 against TSC and the Pensions Department.\n\nMany of the retirees interviewed by the Nation expressed optimism that having issued the earlier directive, Justice Maraga will take up the matter and ensure they are paid.\n\n\u201cWe hope he will take up the matter and help us get justice. Some of my colleagues have since died without getting the dues,\u201d said Mr John Kamau, one of the retirees.\n\nHOPES ON MARAGA\n\nTheir lawyer, Mr Dominic Kimatta, could not hide his joy when he learnt that the Judicial Service Commission had picked Justice Maraga to be the country\u2019s next Chief Justice.\n\nMr Kimatta, who has represented the retired teachers for 18 years, said Justice Maraga will perhaps be in a position to ensure the retirees get justice.\n\nIt is Mr Kimatta who filed and won the case before Justice Maraga in 2008 before the TSC moved to the Court of Appeal and later Supreme Court to challenge the matter.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court upheld Mr Maraga and the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgements, the retirees are yet to receive their payment.\n\nThe last one year has seen the former teachers engage in vicious court battles with the TSC and the Pensions Department.\n\nThe retired teachers have already extended a plea that the judge, if appointed to the position of CJ, helps end the stalemate.\n\nCONTEMPT OF COURT CASE\n\nEarly 2016, the retirees filed a contempt of court application before a Nakuru court against TSC boss Nancy Macharia.\n\nMs Macharia faces a six-month jail term for contempt of the orders by the Supreme Court directing the TSC to liaise with relevant government offices to pay the retirees.\n\nOn Friday last week, the Nakuru High Court issued summons against the Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet for failure to arrest the Director of Pensions in relation to the pension arrears stand-off.\n\nLady Justice Janet Mulwa directed Mr Boinnet to appear in court on October 6, 2016 to explain why he has failed to arrest Mr Shem Nyakutu as directed by the court on September 16.\n\nMr Nyakutu is required in court to explain why the 52,000 retired teachers have not been paid Sh .5 billion part of the Sh42.3 billion pension arrears as directed by the court early in August.\n\nSUMMONED IN COURT\n\nHe is also required to explain the steps the Pensions Department is taking to clear the remaining balance of the dues.\n\nPreviously, the court had summoned the TSC CEO and Mr Nyakutu over the payment impasse.\n\nMr Nyakutu appeared once before the court on August 15 after a warrant of arrest was issued against him on July 26 and confirmed his office received the Sh1.5 billion on June 25 and promised to release the amount to the retired teachers\u2019 accounts in three weeks.\n\nHe said the pensions staff were working hard and were ready to receive the retired teachers\u2019 claim forms.\n\nMr Nyakutu further indicated that his office was working with other stakeholders, including the Controller of Budget, the TSC, and the Attorney-General, as well as the retired teachers to ensure the cash is efficiently released.",

    "text": "Sainsbury\u2019s has posted a second consecutive quarterly fall in sales as it remains under pressure amid the bitter supermarket war and food price deflation.\n\nBritain\u2019s second biggest supermarket, which recently completed a \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos, reported a 1.1 per cent drop in like-for-like sales excluding fuel for the second quarter.\n\nMike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said: \u201cWe continue to make progress against our strategy and, while like-for-like sales were down 1.1 per cent, driven by food price deflation, we delivered like-for-like transaction growth across all channels and total volume growth.\u201d\n\nSainsbury\u2019s added that Argos notched up like-for-like sales growth of 2.3 per cent during the period, with Mr Coupe saying the group will open 200 new digital collection points by the end of the year. Thirty Argos digital outlets will be open in Sainsbury\u2019s stores by Christmas.\n\nThe grocer is slugging it out with rivals in a brutal price war which has eroded margins at all of the so-called big four supermarkets.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s pledged to \u201cremain competitive\u201d, adding that it has made further investments in the prices of everyday items such as broccoli, onions and its frozen deep pan Margherita pizza.\n\n\u201cWe expect the market to remain competitive and the effect of the devaluation of sterling remains unclear. However, Sainsbury\u2019s is well positioned to navigate the changing marketplace and we are confident that our strategy will enable us to continue to outperform our major peers,\u201d Mr Coupe said.\n\nWith profits squeezed by the growth of German discounters Aldi and Lidl Britain\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets - market leader Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons - are all fighting back with price cuts and service improvements.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s has both lowered and simplified its prices, reducing the number of promotions and removing most \u201cmulti-buy\u201d deals.\n\nPhil Dorrell, partner at retail consultants Retail Remedy, said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s is facing a resurgent Tesco and Morrisons. In the next 12 months Asda will also start to regain its footing, and Aldi are in fighting talk, standing by their pledge to be the lowest priced grocer. Quite simply, Sainsburys footfall is falling short.\u201d\n\nSainsbury\u2019s also issued a trading update on Argos, following its takeover of the business earlier this year.\n\nIn its second quarter to August 27, Argos achieved total sales growth of 3 per cent and like-for-like sales growth of 2.3 per cent.\n\nMr Dorrell said: \u201cArgos has been a distraction, of course a \u00a31.4bn purchase will be distracting, and the pressure to ensure that it delivers a return will be immense. However, at what cost to the core business?\u201d",

    "text": "The recent fervor concerning Onondaga County\u2019s ultimatum about moving the Syracuse M&T Jazz Fest from the Onondaga Community College campus to the Lakeview Amphitheater gave members of the community ringing ears. Jazz Fest impresario Frank Malfitano, on vacation at the time of the media squeal, came back early to clear the air when he set up a Sept. 21 press conference at Second Olivet Missionary Baptist Church on Syracuse\u2019s West Side.\n\nMalfitano invited County Executive Joanie Mahoney to the event, as she cordially reinforced the duo\u2019s friendship and the county government\u2019s full support of the annual music festival. Several times during her time at the lectern, Mahoney repeated variations on her declaration that \u201cdecisions about Jazz Fest logistics should be left to Frank.\u201d\n\nTo prove his point about the free festival, Malfitano reinforced the origins of music and community. \u201cWe\u2019re in a black church because this is where the music we present at Jazz Fest was born,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to repay that debt ever, but gospel came from the black church, and that led to rhythm and blues and blues and jazz.\u201d\n\nThe peaceful setting, with pastor Rev. Cyrus L. Thornton giving his blessing, gave the opportunity for Mahoney and Malfitano to publicly kiss each other on the cheek and hug several times.\n\nWhat it came down to was some profound miscommunication \u2014 acknowledged by Malfitano and Mahoney \u2014 and a misunderstanding on the public\u2019s part. \u201cIt\u2019s been overexaggerated,\u201d said the county executive, who jokingly chided Malfitano because he does not own a cellphone. \u201cThe chatter on social media helped perpetuate negative and positive responses.\n\nThe festival was wedged into the County Parks Department section of the proposed Onondaga County budget. The 450-page budget will be finalized shortly and will be followed by a public hearing on Thursday, Oct. 6, and voted on five days later.\n\nMalfitano said Onondaga County has always \u201cstepped up to the plate.\u201d Out of the county\u2019s proposed $1.3 billion budget, his festival totals a drop in the bucket: $75,000. Aside from sponsors M&T Bank, Price Chopper, C&S Companies, National Grid and several other contributors, Jazz Fest does not recieve city, state or federal funding.\n\n\u201cI try to navigate the Good Ship Jazz Fest through political waters. We don\u2019t always vet things with the community perhaps the way we should,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThis time we\u2019re going to do it right. We\u2019re going to be very transparent.\u201d He said the festival raises $400,000 per year and receives $200,000 in donations of goods and services.\n\nAs far as trying to find the monetary investments, the recent publicity has put the 2017 county budget ahead of the game, according to Mahoney. She even joked that if the public told the County Legislature that she was against allocating more money to the event, the members \u2014 even the staunchest conservative Republicans \u2014 would vote to give more.\n\nWhether or not Jazz Fest moves from Onondaga Community College to the Lakeview Amphitheater beyond 2017 is up to Malfitano, said Mahoney, who often expressed her hope that such a move might eventually happen. She cited the amphitheater\u2019s sound system as a plus. However, she acknowledged that Malfitano still had one more year remaining on the OCC contract with Jazz Fest.\n\nMalfitano labeled Lakeview a \u201cworld-class venue\u201d after seeing several summer concerts featuring Ringo Starr and Hall and Oates. \u201cWe would have to take a hard look at the Amp and think the venue through,\u201c he said. Yet Malfitano also spoke fondly about OCC\u2019s attributes, such as the story of meeting his wife there, as well as Jazz Fest\u2019s campus presence offering an opportunity to entice future students.\n\nHe\u2019s also tired of switching venues: \u201cThe next time we move, if we move, it\u2019s going to be a big move and it\u2019s going to be the last move.\u201d In the past five years the festival relocated twice.\n\nThe 70-year-old Malfitano noted the upcoming 35th festival will be a milestone that only about a half-dozen other jazz festivals across the country have accomplished. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this half my life!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nSyracuse\u2019s nomadic Jazz Fest has graced several places throughout the county, including Jamesville Beach, Long Branch Park and Clinton Square. Malfitano admitted to some setbacks along the way, especially the 1983 stint at Song Mountain Ski Resort (\u201cI stumbled. I fell. I failed,\u201d Malfitano said about his past festivals. \u201cBut I got up!\u201d), but he also boasted about having to move from downtown to the college because of the increasingly large crowds.\n\nThe press conference lured local musicians including Frank DeFonda, Paul Davie and Dave Hanlon, as well as small business owners such as Tom Greenwood, who runs a an East Syracuse winery. Greenwood praised Malfitano for his work and loyalty to local enterprises, bringing in and showcasing small businesses, especially those involved in the beverage and agriculture industries.\n\n\u201cJazz Fest more than returns the investment to Onondaga County,\u201d Mahoney stated. \u201cFrank is one of the few people in this county you can point to for making big things happen. I defer to the expert, and we\u2019ll do it where you want to do it. You have my full support.\u201d",

    "text": "TOKYO, Sept 28, 2016 - (JCN Newswire) - Trillium Inc, an automotive cybersecurity startup, has announced the availability of an SDK (software development kit) for its SecureCAR software-based, multi-layered automotive cybersecurity solution and introduced the 'BrainBOX', an IVN-in-a-box. A hardware platform condensed from vehicular wire harness scale to a compact, hand-carried chassis the size of a microwave oven. Both announcements come today from escar Asia 2016* held in Tokyo, where Trillium is conducting on-site demonstrations of both the SecureCAR SDK and the BrainBOX.Trillium developed its SecureCAR IVN (in-vehicle network) security platform as one pillar of a comprehensive cybersecurity suite called SecureIoT, delivering the requisite multi-layered automotive cyber-system from IVN to IPS to SecureOTA. Today's announcement represents an important milestone in the roll-out of the SecureCAR solution, and a significant leap forward from IVN modelling and simulation (based on CAD models) to actual deployment of ECU (Electronic Control Unit) application software on the BrainBOX, including the Trillium SecureCAR cybersecurity kernel.David Uze, Trillium President & CEO, says, \"Technically, we have created a facsimile of an automotive IVN, in-a-box. In combination with the SecureCAR SDK, this represents a signifiant leap forward in the design, benchmarking, implementation and execution of secure automotive ECU to ECU communications. Our BrainBOX allows for significantly faster ECU prototyping and far more accurate simulation, allowing for maximal code and network optimisation prior to mass production. It actually enables extensive real world vehicular testing, outside of the vehicle.\"The SecureCAR SDK enables the integration and execution of Trillium's patent pending SecureCAR software module within automotive ECU application software, encrypting and authenticating the messages of in-vehicle networks like CAN bus, LIN bus, FlexRAY and Ethernet for realtime actuation applications. Using the SecureCAR / BrainBOX development platform; automotive SW developers, Tier1 and semiconductor makers as well as automotive manufacturers can develop, test and run customised cybersecurity software scenarios over actual IVNs allowing engineers to choose the optimal cyber system for their unique vehicular implementations.The BrainBOX IVN-in-a-Box, with 49 ECUs mounted into one compact and portable chassis including LIN, CAN, FlexRAY and ethernet ECUs, is an effective and efficient means to test and run software over any semiconductor chipset / software operating system combination. The BrainBOX enables automotive makers (OEM) and Tier1 to optimise and test their CAD simulation tool performance before prototyping actual vehicular implementations. Commercial versions of the SecureCAR SDK and BrainBOX will begin shipment to automotive simulation and diagnostic tool vendors, semiconductor makers, Tier1 electronic module makers and automotive OEM from October 2016.Dr. Sachio Semmoto, Trillium Chairman and also founder of Japanese telecommunication giants DDI and eAccess, says, \"David and our team are focused on solving cybersecurity problems that have remained unsolved for decades. Trillium's technology is poised to enable automakers to implement a new paradigm cybersecurity platform to protect personal and public safety from the nefarious activities of hackers and government-sponsored cyberterrorism. This technology is critical to the safe and secure operation of connected cars on the roads of today and tomorrow.\"*The 3rd escar ASIA - The world's leading automotive Cyber Security conference - running from Sept. 28 to 29, 2016, in Tokyo, Japan - https://www.escar.info/escar-asia.html.About TrilliumJapan-based Trillium Inc, an automotive IoT cybersecurity startup, has developed the anti-car hacking SecureCAR technology for protecting the in-vehicle networks (IVN) of automobiles and other transportation equipment from cyber attack using advanced encryption, authentication and key management technologies. Trillium's patent pending SecureCAN technology, a key component of its SecureCAR software platform, delivers disruptive technology that was previously thought impossible - realtime encryption, authentication and highly entropic key management of CAN bus.

    "title": "Nature Calls At Cazenovia Art Park",
    "text": "In 2014, Stone Quarry Hill Art Park was highlighted by National Geographic magazine as one of the 10 best sculpture parks in the world. Yet the 104-acre park located in the rolling hills of Cazenovia is still something of a Central New York hidden treasure despite its worldwide acclaim.\n\nWhile exploring the park\u2019s grounds, allow your mind to wander, to decipher what\u2019s real and what\u2019s conjured from imagination. The two are purposefully blended, which was the vision of Stone Quarry founders Dorothy and Bob Riester. The craving for adventure is satisfied. Thoughts and emotions define experience.\n\nStephen Brucker, visitor services and promotions coordinator for Stone Quarry Hill Art Park, guided a Syracuse New Times reporter during a recent visit. The tour began in the offices, which have a quasi cabin-in-the-woods appeal, then moved to the artist-in-residence living quarters before venturing up the stone pathway toward the Riester home.\n\nPart of the evolution of the grounds, after its incorporation as an art park in 1991, was to share space as an inspirational laboratory for local, national and international artists. Stone Quarry houses six artists-in-residence each year for six-week increments. Up the hill, in the art barn and garage, artists are welcome to rent space, perform demonstrations and showcase their artworks during and after their completion.\n\nThe \u201cThird Iteration\u201d installation bends along the driveway in Tim Burton-esque fashion, stretching a quarter-mile in length along the path to the house on the hill. It\u2019s composed of a series of looming triangular arcs. Faded green and unraveling flags wrap around one of the 30-foot-long recycled lamppost legs of each segment.\n\n\u201cContemplating Man,\u201d one of Dorothy Riester\u2019s creations, stands atop the hill and looks over the land with hands in pockets. Despite being a great listener, he\u2019ll offer silence instead of answers.\n\nThe Stone Quarry concept was put into motion in 1958, when the Riesters admired this special nook of Madison County and purchased 23 acres. The Riester home was built in the early 1960s as a summer residence, although the couple continued to buy surrounding acres through the years. (Riester will celebrate her centennial birthday later this year.)\n\nAcross the driveway is an A-frame facility, containing a workspace for artists. The art barn, a laboratory-like garage, accommodates various mediums of expression.\n\n\u201cThe goal of Dorothy Riester was to bring nature indoors and the artist into nature,\u201d said Brucker, an artist himself. Activities within nature \u2014 hiking, meditating, reading \u2014 can influence a piece.\n\nUpon entering the earthy home, visitors will have to step down. Brucker said that the supporting beams were too big and low, and it was easy for Bob Riester to bump his head. Digging down inches solved the problem instead of reconfiguring the ceiling and walls. When strolling into the den, note the familiar musty smell reminiscent of any grandparents\u2019 home; it\u2019s also important to check out the fireplace hood Dorothy had to build three times.\n\nAfter climbing the staircase, which did not have risers \u2014 Dorothy said they impeded the ability to look through the space, so they were removed \u2014 the tour led to the couple\u2019s bedroom. The strategically centered window is the perfect perch from which to see Cazenovia and Oneida lakes in the same frame.\n\nThe first floor\u2019s bird\u2019s nest-shaped library, complete with packed bookshelves, continues to serve as a creative and interactive space. There aren\u2019t any electronic gadgets aside from an old radio. There is a piano, which she didn\u2019t play, and so temptations for distraction are limited.\n\nThe windows are set higher on the walls. This prevents anyone relaxing in the space from noticing possible distractions, such as humans or creatures walking by.\n\nTours of the Riester home are available upon request at Stone Quarry, which is open year-round (call 655-3196 for details). Yet there are plenty of other activities to enjoy as well, such as yoga, art demonstrations and workshops. Children\u2019s camps take place during the summer, and snowshoeing can be enjoyed in the winter.\n\nBrucker\u2019s tour continued on the Vista Trail, beginning with \u201cThreshold\u201d by Takafumi Ide, which is a white outline of the artist\u2019s steps and a front door to his Brooklyn brownstone. Climbing the steps to ring the bell is discouraged. The piece is wired to accommodate a motion-detector light bulb.\n\nMeander through the trees with silver badges, each bearing one verb. Walking further on the trail there is a horse climbing out of the ground, and it\u2019s wearing an expression of panic. From its chest protrudes two small hands, and one is holding the beast\u2019s heart. No, this is not Atreyu encouraging and pulling Artax to get through the Swamp of Sadness, but a tale of love in itself.\n\nThere is a face that stretches from a rock in a similar fashion to Freddy Kreuger, while another man has his face buried in the pages of an oversized book. Whether the hardcover fell on top of him or came alive for a facial attack is unclear.\n\nEnter the \u201cGarden of Reading,\u201d which features one of the park\u2019s more popular pieces of art by David Harper. It shows the evolution of art being taken from nature. Or is it retreating back to nature? From a log sprout shelves and books, which also evolve from blocks lacking detail to shaped books.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure how long this is going to last,\u201d said Brucker, pointing out that the natural decay of the wood can also be a hazard. \u201cSome people feel the need to interact with our art.\u201d He said that interaction is important, but protecting the art and the safety of a person are important. To help keep the exhibit alive, people have added books and sheet music to the piece.\n\nAs Stone Quarry celebrates its silver anniversary, the land can rest easy due to having a long lifespan. There is an easement with the town, stated Brucker. There isn\u2019t a guarantee this land will forever be dedicated or housing an art park, yet because of the Riesters\u2019 efforts their entire property will remain protected even if the sculptures are removed.\n\nOf course, who would want that to happen? The outdoor adventuring can generate comfort simply from feeling lost. If Stone Quarry Hill Art Park feels like a whole new world, imagine what else is out there.",

At the events, undergraduate students learn how to prepare for the upcoming application process and as well as requirements.\n\nJose Miguel Martinez, assistant director of graduate studies resource center, explained that these workshops exist for the students who want to go to grad school, or are even just thinking about it.\n\nHe said that the purpose of the center is to provide assistance and answers to students during the application process.\n\n\u201cThe reason we exist is to help support students who want to go to grad school. We help them in the process, but part of that is outreach,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cA lot of students don\u2019t know what the process is \u2014 we do these workshops to start reaching out to them. If we can plant the seed, they can follow up with us later and try to get more information about it.\u201d\n\nMost grad schools require students to take the Graduate Records Examinations, depending on what program they wish to enter. However, Martinez said some universities are trying to work away from GREs, but it won\u2019t happen anytime soon.\n\nAccording to the Peterson website, an academic site that offers test prep, the GRE is much like the SAT and ACT \u2013 a broad assessment of a student\u2019s critical thinking, analytical writing, verbal reasoning and quantitative reasoning skills.\n\n\u201cI think students go to grad school for a lot of reasons \u2014 mostly to get their certain type of degree they need for their field later on in their life,\u201d said Kurcel Joseph, a senior double majoring in communication and sociology.\n\nSenior organism biology major Juilet Linzmiere said that before deciding to take the GRE, she needs to do more research on schools and programs she wants to apply to.\n\n\u201cFor grad school, you have to know what you\u2019re researching and have your interest, so I think I\u2019m going to take a year off \u2014 [intern] or volunteer,\u201d Linzmier said.\n\nMartinez said some students might overthink the test \u2014 but the key to succeeding is to learn how to take the test and break it down. During the workshop, Martinez told attendees to buy GRE preparation books, take practice tests and download vocabulary apps to better articulate themselves.\n\nThe next grad school workshop will be held Monday from noon \u2013 1:30 p.m. in University Student Union room 304.",

    "text": "Wow, what a start to the season for Leeds Force! I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to kick off the season than beating our local rivals Sheffield Sharks.\n\nIt was always going to be tough start, they are the British Basketball League play-off champions and whatever players they put on the court, it\u2019s always going to be tough so to win in the way we did was special.\n\nRobert Marsden, Leeds Force, (Photo: Kieron Nevison)\n\nA super performance by everyone at Leeds Force secured county bragging rights after we beat the Sharks 79-58 at the Carnegie Sports Arena on Sunday.\n\nBeing a local lad, not living far from Sheffield, it was important to me to be able to beat them for the first time in my career.\n\nI grew up in Doncaster, learned the game with Danum Eagles before moving to Leeds when they were a university and national league basketball programme in 2011.\n\nI stepped up to the BBL with Manchester Giants and also played a year in France with a team called Cognac before returning to Manchester in 2015.\n\nI joined Leeds Force that summer and have just entered my second season with the team.\n\nSo, with all that in mind, I always get extra motivated for a game with Sheffield Sharks.\n\nIt always hurts to lose to them but beating them on Sunday and finally getting over that block was great.\n\nThey have had the bragging rights for a little while now but now we are hoping to wrestle that away from them and be the best team in Yorkshire.\n\nRemember, Leeds Force are starting out on just our third season in the BBL.\n\nWe were strong in most areas of the court. If you look at the stats, especially in the second half, Jack Isenbarger was outstanding. With 14 points in the last quarter, he was unplayable.\n\nOn a personal note, my game felt good and it was good to get some good points on the board, which has given me confidence to now kick on and carry this into the rest of the season.\n\nI got close to reaching 1,000 BBL points on Sunday, I\u2019m just two points off it.\n\nI had no idea about it until someone tweeted me in the week.\n\nIt was on my mind going onto the court but, to be honest, once we got going I completely forgot about it.\n\nMy brother came to me at the end and said \u2018hard luck, you didn\u2019t get it\u2019, but for me it was more about the result and to win by 21 points that was more important.\n\nHopefully, I will be able to get that record against the Cheshire Phoenix this Sunday and that will help us get another two points in the bag. We want to get points in the bag early this year.\n\nLast year, we had a slow start but now as a franchise we are growing and so is our aspiration.\n\nFor me, I want us as high up the table as possible. We finished eighth last year, which was fantastic for us to make the end-of-season play-offs. This year, fourth, fifth or sixth should be our aim.\n\nThe higher we are the easier the draw we will get in the play-offs.\n\nWe have a good, young, hungry roster that are going out and playing with no fear which makes us difficult to come up against.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, we had a great roster last year, too. It was a shame to see most of the boys leave \u2013 the likes of Marek Klaasen who was instrumental for us as we gatecrashed the play-offs \u2013 but we are all at different points in our lives so I understand.\n\nFinally from me this week, the noise from the fans helped us rise to another level and we will need that all season so I hope to see you all back at the Carnegie Sports Arena on Sunday when we face the Cheshire Phoenix.",

    "title": "Trump has turned over tax returns - for lawsuits and loans",
    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 While Donald Trump won't publicly release his income tax returns, the New York businessman has turned them over when it suited his needs \u2014 if he stood to make a profit, needed a loan or when a judge forced him.\n\nPennsylvania gaming regulators were given at least five years' worth and eight boxes full of Trump's tax documents. Nevada, Michigan, Missouri, Indiana and other state gaming officials also had access to multiple years of his returns. Large banks that lent Trump money over the years have also obtained Trump's returns.\n\nOne common thread ties all those who have seen the documents: They can't talk about them.\n\nSuch legal restrictions leave the public with only small glimpses into what Trump's taxes might hold.\n\nIn Monday night's debate, Democrat Hillary Clinton cited documents unearthed by reporters to question whether Trump doesn't want to release his tax returns because he has paid little or no federal income taxes.\n\nTrump's response? \"That makes me smart,\" a comment he disavowed just minutes after the debate. Asked by reporters if he had admitted to not paying federal income taxes, Trump said, \"I didn't say that at all.\"\n\nClinton cited documents unearthed by Politico showing Trump didn't pay any federal income tax during at least two years in the early 1990s because he lost more money than he earned. Other documents show he also didn't pay any federal income taxes in 1978, 1979 and 1984.\n\nVoters know little about Trump's more recent finances beyond his own self-reported estimations of his wealth and listings of his business interests.\n\nIn all cases reviewed by The Associated Press, each person, organization, company or government office that has seen Trump's tax returns is barred from discussing their full contents by professional or legal restrictions.\n\nFor example, employees of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board could face criminal penalties if they leaked information from Trump's tax returns maintained in the board's electronic files, said board spokesman Doug Harbach.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump had turned over any returns to the Missouri Gaming Commission, officials said they were barred by state law from saying what Trump turned over.\n\n\"I could not tell you whether we had them,\" said Edward Grewach, the commission's general counsel.\n\nResponses like these leave the decision to publicly release the taxes solely with Trump, who has repeatedly refused. Trump has cited an IRS audit as his reason for withholding the information, but the IRS and tax experts have said an audit doesn't bar Trump from releasing his taxes. At the debate, Trump said he would release his returns \u2014 over what he described as his attorney's objections \u2014 only after Clinton released roughly 30,000 emails she had deleted from her private server that she had deemed personal.\n\nEarlier this month, Donald Trump Jr. gave a different reason why his father wouldn't release the returns: The American people would ask too many questions.\n\n\"He's got a 12,000-page tax return that would create . financial auditors out of every person in the country asking questions that would detract from (his father's) main message,\" the younger Trump told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.\n\nSince 1976, every major party nominee has released the returns and Clinton has publicly released nearly 40 years' worth. Even Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, released 10 years of his tax returns.\n\nT axe returns don't measure net worth, so they wouldn't verify whether Trump is worth the $10 billion he says he is. But the returns would reveal how much Trump earned from his assets, helping someone work back to an approximation of his net worth.\n\nTrump's own estimates of his income and net worth have previously been scrutinized by those who had access to his tax returns.\n\nFor a decade, Trump tangled with New York City authorities over his city tax bill, a battle first reported in June by journalist David Cay Johnson in The Daily Beast.\n\nIn Trump's 1984 tax filings, he said he had lost money during a time in which he had just completed Trump Tower and regularly boasted about the success of his business deals. Trump also declared that he was primarily a consultant that year, and that his consulting business had $684,000 in business expenses and no income. He provided no receipts to justify the claimed expenses.\n\nCity tax authorities didn't buy it \u2014 and after Trump appealed his tax bill, they fought with him for the next 10 years. Trump lost and was ordered to pay the taxes on more than $1 million in income.\n\nTrump's multibillion-dollar fortune has been questioned by banks that demanded his tax returns before lending him money. Commercial lenders generally require both personal and business tax returns as part of a loan application, and Trump provided such information to North Fork Bank in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThough the bank's evaluations aren't public, discussion of them in a later deposition of Trump revealed they were unflattering. The deposition was taken in a defamation lawsuit Trump filed against journalist Tim O'Brien, who wrote a book that questioned Trump's net worth. Trump lost the suit.\n\n\"(North Fork) concluded in their estimation that your net worth was actually $1.2 billion instead of $3.5 billion as you claimed. Are you aware of that?\" asked O'Brien's attorney, Andrew Ceresney.\n\nTrump said he had not known that, but dismissed the quality of the bank's opinion.\n\n\"The numbers are wrong,\" he said.\n\nNorth Fork wasn't alone in marking down Trump's net worth. Deutsche Bank also reviewed Trump's finances as of 2004, deeming him to be worth \"give or take $788 million,\" Ceresney said in the deposition. The attorney did not say whether Deutsche Bank relied on Trump's tax return in its calculation.\n\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment about its evaluation of Trump's worth, but the bank is required to keep customer information confidential by law. Capital One Bank \u2014 it bought North Fork in 2006 \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment by phone and email.\n\nO'Brien did not respond to requests for comment, but in a story he wrote for Bloomberg, O'Brien said he was barred from discussing the contents of Trump's tax returns because they were produced under seal in the court case.\n\nIn addition to a suggestion of his worth, Trump's tax returns would reveal his charitable contributions. Despite boasting of sweeping generosity, the AP reported more than a year ago that there is little record of substantial personal philanthropy from Trump.\n\nTrump has been dogged by questions about his personal giving and how his namesake foundation operates. The Washington Post has reported that Trump used donations given by others to pay for legal settlements, political contributions and even purchase portraits of himself.\n\nPublic disclosure would resolve many of these questions for voters.\n\nA new Associated Press-GfK poll found that just under half of registered voters\u2014 46 per cent \u2014 say it is very important for candidates to release their tax returns, though Democrats were far more likely say it was very or extremely important than Republicans.\n\nA recent Monmouth University poll also found that most Americans are aware that Trump has not released his tax returns, and just over half think it's because he is hiding something he does not want the public to know.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Emily Swanson contributed to this report.\n\n___",

    "text": "Actor Tom Hanks speaks at the launch of the Hidden Heroes campaign for military caregivers. Hidden Heroes is a campaign created by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation to call attention to the 5.5 million military and veteran caregivers in the United States. Ken-Yon Hardy/Stars and Stripes\n\nWASHINGTON -- The public service announcement begins with Tom Hanks introducing himself on a black screen.\n\nHe walks over to a man in a wheelchair, who is missing both legs and is flanked by his wife and two daughters. His name is Chaz Allen \u2013 Airborne, wounded in combat. Hanks calls him a hero and thanks him for his service.\n\nThen Hanks introduces himself to Allen\u2019s wife, Jessica. She\u2019s a hero too, Hanks says. Because Chaz Allen needs a lot of help, and his wife is also raising their two girls.\n\n\u201cWhich makes me want to thank you for your service, Jessica,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cYou are a hidden hero.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 5.5 million caregivers for the nation\u2019s military wounded or ill, and they often go unrecognized, Hanks said.\n\nWith this message, he joined the Elizabeth Dole Foundation on the stage of the Capitol Congressional Auditorium on Tuesday to launch the Hidden Heroes campaign aimed at shining a light nationwide on the challenges military caregivers face and to rally communities, nonprofits and businesses to help those caregivers function and cope.\n\n\u201cBringing our country\u2019s hidden heroes \u2013 and that\u2019s what they are, heroes that are hidden and out of sight \u2013 bringing them out of the shadows and honoring their service is a companion piece, I think, to welcoming home those who have served,\u201d said Hanks, chairman of the Hidden Heroes campaign.\n\n\u201cI am going to start and end with the same simple question to each of you and all those who are watching at home and around the world on our live stream: What part in the movement are you going to play? I trust the stories of honor and sacrifice we will now share \u2026 will bring you to your answer.\"\n\nDuring a two-hour presentation Tuesday before several hundred invited guests that was streamed live, Sen. Elizabeth Dole was joined by Hanks, NBC News Special Correspondent Tom Brokaw, community and business leaders and caregivers who shared their stories.\n\nThey send their loved ones off to war, and one day pick up a phone and their lives have changed. Their son, daughter or spouse comes home in need of constant care.\n\nIt\u2019s overwhelming and isolating, said Kristi Dumas, whose husband, Hal, is a veteran of the Iraq war. He experienced the worst of combat and saw battle that left many of his buddies with catastrophic injuries. His emerged more slowly, after he came home.\n\n\u201cWhen you care for a veteran with invisible wounds, your role as caregiver is invisible too,\u201d Dumas said. Coworkers don\u2019t know when your husband\u2019s nightmares kept you awake all night; people at the mall don\u2019t know you are constantly keeping an eye out for triggers or watching your veteran for telltale signs.\n\n\u201cWe love and admire our veterans,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it can be isolating and challenging.\u201d\n\nBrokaw described how with just 1 percent of the country serving in the military, few understand what military families face when their loved ones go off to war. Even fewer recognize what happens when the servicemembers come back in need of care.\n\nIt\u2019s the nation\u2019s obligation, he said, to help with that care.\n\n\u201cWhen we go to war, we should all go to war,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the enduring lesson of what\u2019s going on now.\u201d\n\nSince launching her foundation in 2012 to support military caregivers, Dole said it has brought together more than 300 military caregivers and began offering them services \u2013 online classes, free training webinars, job fairs, mental respite retreats, family counseling and financial planning and legal resources.\n\nThe foundation drew attention to military caregivers, and veterans groups began to incorporate programs for caregivers into their missions, she said. That has empowered the foundation to dream even bigger.\n\n\u201cToday the foundation envisions an America where military caregivers are empowered, appreciated and recognized for their service to the nation. We envision an America where supporting military caregivers is no longer a cause, it is part of the culture of our nation.\u201d\n\nAs part of the launch, the campaign is calling on cities across the United States to commit to helping military caregivers. On Tuesday, the campaign issued a list of 54 cities from San Diego to Little Rock, Ark., and Washington to Yuma, Ariz., that have made the commitment.\n\nJessica Allen introduced Hanks again at the end of Tuesday's event, saying she hoped the campaign would \u201cawaken America to the service and sacrifice of our nation\u2019s caregivers.\u201d\n\nShe said when she got the call asking whether she wanted to bring her family to California to meet Hanks, it was a mix of excitement and also a bit of alarm. Traveling in a military caregiver family is never easy, she said.\n\n\u201cImagine all the moving parts \u2013 literally all the legs you have to take on the plane,\u201d she said to laughter from the other caregivers.\n\nHanks described how from the day she got the call and ran to the bedside of her sweetheart, \u201cshe immediately began managing and caring and taking control. And it\u2019s what she has done very single day since.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery single day,\u201d Hanks emphasized. He added later: \u201cWe need your help today. We will need it tomorrow. We will need it every single day.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the Hidden Heroes campaign, what you can do to help or to register as a caregiver, go to www.hiddenheroes.org.\n\ncahn.dianna@stripes.com\n\nTwiitter: @DiannaCahn",

    "text": "Last updated on: September 28, 2016 13:17 IST\n\n'The response to terror is not always reciprocal terror, nor is launching a conventional response the best response.'\n\n'The best response is to make the sponsor pay a price he cannot afford,' says former R&AW chief Vikram Sood.\n\nIMAGE: A soldier near the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. Photograph: Rajesh Karkera/Rediff.com\n\nThe Uri terror attacks certainly originated from Pakistan occupied Kashmir or Pakistan and were sponsored by Pakistan. Eighteen brave men, mostly from the Bihar Regiment and Dogra Regiment, were killed. A readout of their names shows that they had come from all over India.\n\nClearly, this was war on India. This was terror at its ugliest. It also must be admitted that the jihadists had much better intelligence about their target, were well equipped and had some local help.\n\nOne has only to read what Pakistani leaders have been saying about India over the years and this does not mean only 'leaders' like Muhamed Saeed or Masood Azhar, but even many of their democrats like Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto or eminences like A Q Khan, and then understand their visceral hatred for India.\n\nFor this lot, and many more, they were the rightful heirs to the throne in Delhi after the British left and today's Hindu BJP majority is a particular anathema. This attitude pervades the thinking in their army, civil service and the political circles although some may be too suave to say so.\n\nThis is what we are up against when we deal with Pakistan.\n\nIMAGE: A shop during relaxation of curfew in Srinagar. Photograph: PTI Photo\n\nThere are many in India who persist with their belief that political circles in Pakistan have a different point of view on India in comparison to the army's stance on India.\n\nWhen it relates to India, the Pakistan army, ruling politicians from the Punjab, the civil service and civil society have the same view.\n\nThey may have differences when it comes to handling Balochistan, Sindh, the MQM, the economy, education policies, freedom of the media, but not about India and Pakistan's claim on Kashmir.\n\nIt is naive for us to hope that if we are sufficiently nice to Pakistani politicians, make concessions, this could drive a wedge between the politicians and the army and lead to a more conciliatory approach by Pakistani politicians and civil society.\n\nBoth are under the yoke of the Pakistan army and this is the State within the State that has to be tackled.\n\nAn olive branch in response to each depredation is viewed as a sign of weakness, not statesmanship as some of us would like to believe.\n\nOne of the most incongruous hopes and contradictory approaches has been the recommendation that we treat the Hurriyat as being representative of the people of the Kashmir valley and therefore authorised to decide for the entire state.\n\nWe also pay tax payers' money for their security, upkeep and medical benefits amounting to crores while they retain their secessionist stance. This is absurd logic.\n\nThis bunch represents no one except themselves, cannot win an election and are the mouth-pieces of Pakistan. It is only the elected representatives in the state assembly who represent the people.\n\nBesides, we have tried this approach for the last 70 years, but it has not worked. It is time we tried a different approach.\n\nIMAGE: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti. Photograph: Umar Ganie\n\nSeparate Kashmir from Pak relations\n\nThe domestic issue of Kashmir must be separated from our relations with Pakistan and both must be tackled separately.\n\nPakistan's avowed policy is the dismemberment of India, and Kashmir is the route. Kashmir is not the end. They would follow their war of attrition, their thousand-year war, with a thousand cuts, in the hope that India will succumb one day.\n\nKashmir is in this state today, not just because of Pakistan, but also because of the politics of our dynastic politicians who have ruled the state. Every periodic crisis means the politicians turn to the security forces to help bail them out.\n\nIn the process, it is the army which gets the blame whereas the real fault lies with the political leaders who have never made good use of the interregnums to sort out issues among themselves.\n\nWhen Pakistan launches its terror attacks, it has a fair idea how we and the world will react and it knows that it can prepare for the next attack with impunity.\n\nThe more reasonable nuclear powers consider nuclear weapons as a deterrent. Pakistan, being an irresponsible State, openly considers its nuclear weapons as a strike weapon against enemy India and uses its cover to continue its jihadi warfare against India.\n\nDespite the best arrangements, acts of terror will take place. But when a terror strikes in the same region with similar tactics, routes and targets, this is not just a security breach, but a systemic failure.\n\nObviously, where the security systems and the intelligence systems are not adequate or imperfectly coordinated, the chances of terror are higher.\n\nWhen an attack takes place, the first priority is to neutralise the attack, save lives, move the injured to hospitals, and not to look for causes. High decibel debates and fists punched in air, are just that. So much air.\n\nWhat India needs is sustained action taken at a time of our choosing, all things considered and in cold calculated rage.\n\nIMAGE: Srinagar on Eid-ul-Zuha this year. Photograph: Umar Ganie\n\nA terrorist is a terrorist\n\nWe must get our narrative right and this is highly important because the battle is psychological and one of perceptions.\n\nTherefore, a terrorist is a terrorist; he is not a misguided youth, a freedom fighter, nor a gunman, non-State actor, enemy of humanity, rogue elements.\n\nTroubles in Kashmir are not intifada because the Indian Army is not an occupation force. Let us also not delude ourselves.\n\nThere is no such thing as rogue elements in the ISI or in the Pakistan army. These are ploys designed to fool the gullible or make it acceptable to those wet behind their ears or introduce deniability, helplessness and confusion.\n\nReactions in New Delhi after the Uri attack were also true to form. One section went hyperbolic in its condemnation, with politicians giving the usual fire and brimstone sound-bytes.\n\nDiscussions on national channels were on similar lines while some political parties and even television channels seemed to enjoy the seeming discomfiture of the government.\n\nEqually bizarre were those open discussions on special operation capabilities and comparative strengths in intelligence capabilities by persons not well qualified to comment.\n\nThe US is far too involved with its own elections and the Manhattan bombings to say anything more than what it has. The suspect arrested in the Manhattan bombing, Ahmed Raham Khan, has the inevitable Pakistan connection having spent a year there. Yet, the US will not do anything more if we remember that it did nothing to Pakistan even when it was steadfastly duplicitous with the US.\n\nThe John Kerry-Nawaz Sharif joint statement in New York was sufficiently anodyne and Pakistan did not get a public rap on the knuckles. True, it has condemned Pakistan for this act of terror, has downgraded its relationship with Pakistan for its own reasons and in judgement of its interests, not because of us.\n\nIt will still expect India and Pakistan to amicably resolve this issue.\n\nIMAGE: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj addresses the United Nation General Assembly in New York, September 26, 2016. Photograph: Paresh Gandhi/India Abroad\n\nDefend ourselves\n\nNo other country will do more for us than we ourselves do to defend our interests. The West will remain appropriately condemnatory in its commentary. The Chinese have issued some neutral statement and it has only been Putin's Russia which had the courage to stand by its friend, despite our recent dalliance.\n\nAll major powers have condemned this attack in Uri. Even the OIC has said so too, but their stance on Kashmir has not changed. That is as far it will go; for us, therefore, this episodic condemnation may be satisfying but the actual battle has to be fought by us.\n\nNevertheless, it seems to be our moment internationally with some excellent work done by our diplomats. We should capitalise on this international sympathy. This would be done, not by being the good boy all over again, but by pushing forward some hard realism.\n\nRespond at right time\n\nThe response to terror is not always reciprocal terror, nor is launching a conventional response the best response. The best response is to make the sponsor pay a price he cannot afford.\n\nSo far, in our national reactions we are like a bamboo forest that bends with the wind, but when enraged we burn fiercely. The embers, however, cool fast enough.\n\nInstead, we need cold rage and not looking over our shoulders all the time.\n\nIn our actions all these years, we kept wanting to look good and seek international approbation instead of pursuing our national interest more single mindedly.\n\nFinally, the response has to be long term strangulation of the disease, not dramatic gestures.\n\nIMAGE: The Uri army camp, September 20, 2016. Photograph: PTI\n\nThis requires the following attributes. A long term policy that is sustained by successive governments. Only then can we have a strategy to deal with this.\n\nFrom this follow, tactics and to deploy these tactics we need abilities -- of intelligence, weaponry and a mobile effective special operation and unacknowledged covert capability.\n\nTo make these effective we need the political will to sustain a policy despite setbacks and not get swayed by domestic political gamesmanship. We need greater media responsibility that looks beyond TRPs.\n\nUntil we develop these doctrines, capabilities and political will, we would continue to see more and more terror attacks in India.\n\nIt is of doubtful utility if we simply keep creating new structures by cannibalising existing one instead of strengthening the ones that exist.\n\nWe may be the world's largest importer of defence equipment, yet it seems to be perennially short of essential equipment of different kinds.\n\nObviously, there is a huge disconnect in the system and unless this is corrected we will remain ill equipped to handle threats which cannot be tackled by sentiment alone.\n\nThere are some options available to us. Unless we want to continue to pussy-foot and expect the world to do something for us and that something is not we have the courage to do ourselves.\n\nLet us remember that the US policy will remain ambivalent on Pakistan-India relations in keeping with its age-old policy of not allowing any regional power to become strong enough to challenge US interests in the region.\n\nThere is a dichotomy here, but the US policy is full of such regional contradictions. So India should be strong enough to challenge China and strong enough to overwhelm Pakistan.\n\nThe Russians have a renewed interest in South Asia after their successes in West Asia and the failure of US policies. They seem to have retreated from their earlier policy of getting too close to Pakistan at least for the time being. Maybe it is a signal to us.\n\nOne can visualise a renewed great power interest in our immediate neighbourhood. The Russians with their successes in West Asia would like to consolidate its presence in Afghanistan, Iran and India. The Chinese look at the entire region as their preserve and the US is the status quo power.\n\nClash of interest is inevitable, as in the South China Sea. India must therefore move quickly to safeguard its interests.\n\nCross border raids and infiltration by Pakistani terrorists have the Pakistan army's backing and it stands to reason that our response should be relentless trans-border bombardment all the way from Poonch-Rajouri to Saltoro. This would be the immediate response to terror from across.\n\nThe danger of army action across the international border is that if it is too successful, it could trigger a nuclear war. And action limited to PoK presents military difficulties because of the terrain, and also may not be sufficient to compel the Pakistanis to shut down their jihad factories.\n\nAir strikes are a tempting option. However, India lacks the intelligence and surveillance capabilities that will ensure the targets struck are actually terrorist camps.\n\nNevertheless, Pakistan believes that India is now on the path towards stepping up covert activities in Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan and it may be useful to keep deepening the Pakistani neuroses here as a bargaining chip to get it to shut down its jihadi shops.\n\nPakistan remains China's catspaw against India and is fast becoming China's vital geo-strategic thrust into the Arabian Sea and West Asia. We are in reality in the midst of a two-front undeclared war.\n\nMeanwhile, China is concerned about its unimpeded access to Gilgit-Baltistan through which the Karakoram Highway passes. Without access to this region, China's entire strategy for the China Pakistan Economic Corridor falls down. Pakistan would also suffer if all that CPEC promises do not materialise.\n\nIMAGE: Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif in Lahore, December 25, 2015.\n\nThere are other long term options if we accept that the problem is going to be with us for a long time. In all its pronouncements from the time of independence, Pakistan's leaders have treated India as a Permanent Enemy.\n\nIt exhibits its policy through constant jihadi activity. Since Pakistan considers us as its enemy, we should accept this by declaring Pakistan as an Enemy State.\n\nParliament should pass a resolution declaring Pakistan as a State sponsor of terrorism. No one else will do this unless we do this. This would entail sanctions and maybe our traders will suffer more. This is a price we will have to pay.\n\nThat being so, we are entitled to examine each and every treaty that we have signed with Pakistan. This means we revisit some, abrogate others. This would include the Indus Waters Treaty, Most Favoured Nation status to Pakistan and others relating to trade.\n\nPakistan has carried out jihad against India under a nuclear umbrella. And has openly declared its four-part low threshold for use of nuclear weapons against India. It does not believe in a 'No First Use' policy that we hold dear to our hearts.\n\nThis needs a rethink and ideally Pakistan should be made to adopt a similar policy. We would therefore need to engage the international community as a responsible power trying to make a dangerous juvenile delinquent see reason.\n\nWe need to bring China into this as Pakistan's abbettor as the supplier of nuclear technology and material to that country.\n\nWe may not succeed in completely isolating Pakistan internationally, but on our part we should reduce all interactions with that country, including any regional multilateral events that are hosted by Pakistan. The urge to play the astute diplomat should be resisted for some time.\n\nStrategically, we should pull out all stops and get the Chahbahar Project in Iran into high gear. Japan has shown interest in this and we should consult the Iranians, Afghans and Central Asians to get the Japanese on board.\n\nWe should work more closely with Myanmar in the development of our north east and their northwest and north. This would lead to access to South East Asia.\n\nOn the Baloch issue, there could be greater coordination with Afghanistan and Iran although we have to be careful about Iranian sensitivities.\n\nIMAGE: A US soldier teaches his Indian counterpart how to fire an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. Photograph: Staff Sergeant Samuel Northrup/US Army photo.\n\nChinese vulnerabilities\n\nWe should have a close look at Chinese vulnerabilities too. India's China policy would need a rethink especially on issues of trade where China would be vulnerable.\n\nIts vulnerabilities relate to its banking system, large inventories, and rising labour costs leading to actions by India that say that a free ride in the Indian market is over.\n\nWe need to intensively examine the embedded cyber technology that China has been using in key manufactured products exported to India in the power and telecommunications sectors. We have to get aggressive and resilient here.\n\nFinally, there is the traditional covert option. Since it is covert, it is totally deniable and not open for discussions.\n\nVikram Sood, former chief, Research and Analysis Wing, India's external intelligence agency, is currently Adviser, Observer Research Foundation, where this article first appeared.",

    "title": "Trump turned over tax returns - for lawsuits, loans, casinos",
    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 While Donald Trump won't publicly release his income tax returns, the New York businessman has turned them over when it suited his needs \u2014 if he stood to make a profit, needed a loan or when a judge forced him.\n\nPennsylvania gaming regulators were given at least five years' worth and eight boxes full of Trump's tax documents. Nevada, Michigan, Missouri, Indiana and other state gaming officials also had access to multiple years of his returns. Large banks that lent Trump money over the years have also obtained Trump's returns.\n\nOne common thread ties all those who have seen the documents: They can't talk about them.\n\nIn all cases reviewed by The Associated Press, each person, organization, company or government office that has seen Trump's tax returns is barred from discussing their full contents by professional or legal restrictions.\n\nFor example, employees of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board could face criminal penalties if they leaked information from Trump's tax returns maintained in the board's electronic files. Missouri officials are similarly barred from discussing the returns by state law.\n\nThat leaves the public knowing little about Trump's more recent finances beyond the few details that have trickled out in public documents unearthed by reporters, Trump's own self-reported estimations of his wealth and statements like the one he made in Monday's debate.\n\nWhile Democrat Hillary Clinton questioned whether Trump's tax returns might reveal that he has paid little or no taxes, Trump said he was \"smart\" for not paying federal income taxes in some years.\n\nTrump referred to public documents unearthed by Politico showing he didn't pay any federal income tax during at least two years in the early 1990s because he lost more money than he earned. Other documents show he also didn't pay any federal income taxes in 1978, 1979 and 1984, but the documents provided only limited information about other aspects of Trump's finances that could be settled by him releasing his tax returns.\n\nTrump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns citing an IRS audit, but the IRS and tax experts have said an audit doesn't bar Trump from making the documents public. Since 1976, every major party nominee has released the returns and Clinton has publicly released nearly 40 years' worth. Even Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, released 10 years of his tax returns.\n\nTrump's tax returns would reveal his charitable contributions. Despite boasting of sweeping generosity, the AP reported more than a year ago that there is little record of substantial personal philanthropy from Trump. Trump has been dogged by questions about his personal giving and how his namesake foundation operates. The Washington Post has reported that Trump used donations given by others to pay for legal settlements, political contributions and even purchase portraits of himself.\n\nThe returns would also reveal how much Trump earned from his assets, helping someone work back to an approximation of his net worth to compare to his own estimation. Though the returns wouldn't give an exact measure.\n\nTrump's own estimates of his income and net worth have previously been scrutinized by those who had access to his taxes.\n\nFor a decade, Trump tangled with New York City authorities over his city tax bill, a battle first reported in June by journalist David Cay Johnson in The Daily Beast.\n\nIn Trump's 1984 tax filings, he said he had lost money during a time in which he had just completed Trump Tower and regularly boasted about the success of his business deals. Trump also declared that he was primarily a consultant that year, and that his consulting business had $684,000 in business expenses and no income. He provided no receipts to justify the claimed expenses.\n\nCity tax authorities didn't buy it \u2014 and after Trump appealed his tax bill, they fought with him for the next ten years. Trump lost and was ordered to pay the taxes on more than $1 million in income.\n\nTrump's multibillion-dollar fortune has also been questioned by banks that demanded his tax returns before lending him money. Commercial lenders generally require both personal and business tax returns as part of a loan application, and Trump provided such information to North Fork Bank in 2004 and 2005.\n\nAccording to a deposition of Trump taken in a defamation lawsuit he filed against journalist Tim O'Brien, North Fork concluded that Trump's net worth was $1.2 billion and not the $3.5 billion he had said. Deutsche Bank also reviewed Trump's finances as of 2004, deeming him to be worth \"give or take $788 million,\" according to the deposition.\n\nTrump, who disputed the findings in the deposition, lost the defamation suit.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Emily Swanson contributed to this report.\n\n___",

    "text": "September 28, 2016 11:41 IST\n\nWith speculations rife of India abrogating the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan, Islamabad has taken its case to the World Bank, urging it to stop New Delhi from making illegal constructions on the Neelum and Chenab rivers.\n\nAccording to Dawn, an official statement issued by the Pakistan embassy in Washington on Tuesday said, \"In the meeting with the Pakistani delegation, the World Bank committed itself to timely fulfilling its obligations under the treaty while remaining neutral.\"\n\nAttorney General Ashtar Ausaf Ali-led Pakistani delegation met senior World Bank officials at its headquarters in Washington to discuss Pakistan's recent request for arbitration under Article IX of the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960.\n\nThe Article IX of the treaty deals with arbitration of disputes between the parties concerning the interpretation or application of the treaty or the existence of any fact which, if established, might constitute a breach of the treaty.\n\nThe World Bank was also reminded by Pakistan that the treaty gives the bank an important role in establishing a court of arbitration by facilitating the process of appointment of three judges, called Umpires, to the Court. Both the countries can appoint two arbitrators.\n\nThe Pakistani delegation, in its meetings with World Bank officials, insisted on early appointment of the judges and setting up the court.\n\nThe Pakistani delegation consisted, besides the attorney general, of Water and Power secretary Muhammad Younus Dagha; Pakistan's Commissioner for Indus Water Mirza Asif Baig; and Joint Secretary (Water) Ahmad Irfan Aslam and Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States Jalil Abbas Jilani and World Bank's Executive Director for Pakistan Nasir Khosa.\n\nThe officials representing the World Bank were Senior Vice President Anne-Marie LeRoy, Vice President for South Asia Annette Dixon, Deputy General Counsel for Operations Alberto Ninio, Chief Counsel for South Asia Melinda Good and Senior Counsel for International Waterways Victor Mosoti.\n\nMeanwhile, Advisor to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz has warned India that if it revokes the Indus Water Treaty, Islamabad would treat it as \"an act of war\", adding that such a step would \"provide China a justification to consider the suspension of waters of the Brahmaputra River\".\n\nSpeaking at the National Assembly, Aziz on Tuesday said the Indian act can be taken as a breach of international peace, which will give Islamabad a good reason to approach the United Nations Security Council.\n\n\"Its revocation can be taken as an act of war, or a hostile act against Pakistan. It is highly irresponsible on the part of India to even consider revocation of the Indus Water Treaty. Unilateral revocation of IWT can pose a threat to Pakistan and its economy. This Indian act can be taken as a breach of international peace, and hence, will give Pakistan a good reason to approach the UNSC,\" Aziz said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met with officials to review provisions of the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.\n\nNew Delhi ruled out cancelling the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan but is looking for ways of increasing its use of waters that flow from India but are controlled by Pakistan.\n\nThe treaty was inked in 1960 by the India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and then Pakistan President Ayub Khan, which allocates 80 percent of water to Pakistan from the six-river Indus Water System, including Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum that flows from India to Pakistan.\n\nThe treaty, brokered by the World Bank, is often considered to be one-sided and there has been growing clamour to relook at it. The pact has survived wars and phases of frosty ties between India and Pakistan.\n\nAccording to reports, India currently generates about 3,000 megawatts of energy from hydropower plants along rivers in Kashmir, but believes the region has the potential to produce 18,000 megawatts.\n\nIMAGE: A child stands near the Chenab river with the Baglihar hydroelectric project in Jammu and Kashmir.
