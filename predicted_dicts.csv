The Bank admitted on Thursday evening that its IT system was suffering “intermittent technology communication problems” following a “regular internal update”.

The problem impaired the central bank’s ability to process a limited number of transactions for wholesale counterparties, leading it to implement “workarounds” to enable the Bank to operate as normal.

However, on Friday morning, the Bank said that the issue had been fixed overnight, but said that wholesale counterparty transactions may be delayed as it plays catch up.

A statement read: “Technology communications problems reported by the Bank yesterday have been fixed overnight.

“Systems are now working normally, although there is some catch-up work to complete.

“We expect to be able to process business as normal today, but in order to catch up from yesterday, wholesale counterparty transactions may be dealt with somewhat later in the day than usual.”

The real-time gross settlement (RTGS) service and the Chaps system, which retail banking customers rely on, were not affected so the general public will see “no impact on any of their banking services”, the Bank added.

In 2014, the Bank suffered an IT outage that did affect Chaps and RTGS, impacting thousands of transactions such as home sales.

Following the debacle, Governor Mark Carney ordered a “thorough, independent review” of the payments system."	{'glitch_type': ['software'], 'victim': ['the central bank’s ability to process a limited number of transactions for wholesale counterparties'], 'manufacturer': ['Bank of England'], 'duration': ['overnight'], 'severity_scale': [], 'money_loss': [], 'other_loss': ['wholesale counterparty transactions may be dealt with somewhat later in the day than usual'], 'reason': ['intermittent technology communication problems', 'regular internal update']}	{'glitch_type': [], 'victim': ['Bank'], 'manufacturer': [], 'duration': ['Thursday', 'evening', 'Friday', 'morning', 'overnight', 'yesterday', 'today', 'yesterday', 'later in the day', '2014'], 'severity_scale': [], 'money_loss': [], 'other_loss': [], 'reason': []}

Several prominent reviewers said Wednesday they could not recommend the device because of a wifi glitch that causes cellular connectivity problems.

The Watch Series 3 starts at $399 and was launched alongside new iPhone models. Unlike previous versions of the watch, it has cellular network connectivity built in.

Apple said the watch can experience LTE connectivity problems when it connects to open wi-fi networks such as at a hotel or a coffee shop.

The company is “investigating a fix for a future software release,” Apple spokeswoman Amy Bessette told Reuters.

Many reviewers such as the New York Times praised the new features and gave generally positive assessments.

But other prominent publications, including the Wall Street Journal and The Verge, recommended against purchasing the new model because the LTE cellular data connectivity did not work as expected.

The mixed reviews weighed on Apple shares, which closed down about 1.7 percent at $156.07.

“Considering that my Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE (both first and second review units) didn’t function like it was supposed to, I can’t recommend buying it — and paying the monthly cell fee — based on promises,” Verge reviewer Lauren Goode wrote.

Apart from connection issues, some reviewers were disappointed with the drain on the watch’s battery while making calls. Apple had touted up to 18 hours of battery life but said the watch would get only one hour on a cellular phone call.

Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst with Loup Ventures, doubted issues with the Series 3 Watch would hurt Apple’s bottom line. “That review takeaway is a negative but is not a surprise. This is the first generation watch with LTE,” he told Reuters.

Bob O‘Donnell, an analyst with Techanlysis Research, said the watch reviews, paired with reviews of the iPhone 8 that were generally positive but described the phone as an incremental improvement on its predecessor, put more pressure on the iPhone X to garner good press before its Nov. 3 launch.

Apple also experienced hiccups with iOS 11, the new operating system the firm released Tuesday.

China Unicom, in a statement on its Weibo microblogging account, said Internet access was disrupted from 1:25 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. local time.

The company attributed the outage to a glitch in a piece of equipment in its backbone network - a critical, high-level layer in a national Internet infrastructure.

Internet users later took to social media to complain about the outage, with comments indicating those affected were in areas as distant as Tianjin city in the north and Shanghai in the east, as well as in inland regions.

In February, China Unicom said it had 69 million broadband customers as well as 296 million people subscribed to its mobile phone network.

“We experienced a brief system outage this evening, but the issue is now resolved,” Spirit spokesman Derek Dombrowski said.

“The outage lasted an hour and directly impacted 16 flights,” Dombrowski said, adding that the company was investigating the cause of the problem.

Earlier, the airline asked the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to ground all of its flights systemwide due to the computer problem, the FAA said in a tweet. The agency said about 30 minutes later that the ground stop had been canceled.

Spirit, a fast-growing U.S. budget airline, operates more than 400 daily flights to 60 destinations in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.
