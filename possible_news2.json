    "text": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The Wisconsin Assembly has authorized Attorney General Brad Schimel to investigate how evidence collected during a secret investigation into Republican Gov. Scott Walker's campaign was leaked to a newspaper.\n\nThe Guardian US in September published hundreds of sealed documents from the so-called John Doe investigation, which was shut down by conservative state Supreme Court justices in 2015.\n\nThe Assembly Organizational Committee voted 5-3 on Wednesday to allow Schimel to investigate the leaks. The \"no\" votes all came from Democrats. Minority Leader Peter Barca, who sits on the committee, issued a statement saying Schimel should focus on potential legal violations described in the documents.\n\n\"It is hard to understand why Republicans would focus solely on the leak and not the potential crimes,\" Barca said.\n\nSchimel, a Republican, asked the state Supreme Court in October to appoint a special master to look into the leak. The high court refused in November, saying it's up to the executive branch to investigate.\n\nSchimel said earlier this month that he would likely seat a grand jury to investigate. State Justice Department Johnny Koremenos said in an email that Schimel had \"reviewed and accepted the authorization\" but did not say what might happen next. Asked for a response to Barca's statement, Koremenos said only that the agency will investigate all violations of the law. He did not elaborate.\n\nWisconsin law allows the attorney general to appear as a party in a civil or criminal matter at the request of the governor or one legislative house.\n\nA group of prosecutors led by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, launched the John Doe probe to determine whether Walker's 2012 recall campaign illegally coordinated with outside conservative groups. The state Supreme Court said in its ruling halting the probe that such coordination is legal as long as it doesn't become express advocacy, a political term for advertising that specifically asks voters to defeat or elect a candidate.\n\nThe leaked documents showed how Walker's top campaign adviser was coordinating with the group Club for Growth on how to spend the millions Walker was raising to help himself and Republican senators win 2011 and 2012 recall campaigns. The Guardian also reported the documents showed a leading manufacturer of lead that was once used in paint was among a host of corporate leaders who donated to Club for Growth.\n\nDemocrats launched the recalls out of anger over Walker's signature law that limited public unions' collective bargaining rights.\n\nBe sure and try our new SNOWCAST APP!

    "text": "The Traffic Scotland National Control Centre is fully operational with Storm Barbara\u2019s effects being felt over Scotland.\n\nTransport Minister Humza Yousaf has chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government\u2019s Resilience Team this morning (Friday) where he was given an update on stormy conditions and their impact.\n\nThe Met Office is warning that Scotland will be subjected to severe weather for the rest of this week and into next week with strong winds, heavy rain and wintry showers all featuring. The worst of the conditions today are expected over the far north of the country and the Western and Northern Isles where an Amber alert is force today. The unsettled conditions are expected to remain with a further Amber alert for Storm Conor now issued for the far north on Boxing Day.\n\nThe effects are being felt on the transport system as people make their way home for the festive season. Operators do not take the decision to cancel services lightly but the safety of passengers and crew is the top priority.\n\nOn the ferries, as expected cancellations are in place and operators have been proactively contacting customers to make them aware. We are also expecting revised schedules and cancellations of flights to the islands. The situation is replicated on the railways, where a revised timetable is in place.\n\nThe trunk road network is coping well so far with some restrictions and maybe even temporary closures on bridges expected across the day. The Skye, Kessock and Dornoch crossings will be the most susceptible. The operating companies have specialist equipment in place to help deal with flooding and our TRISS teams are stationed across the network to assist with any debris on the network.\n\nLinks to all of the information have been pulled together on the Traffic Scotland website and people are being urged to check the latest on conditions before they go.\n\nResponder authorities and essential services such as telecoms, electricity, water and gas in the areas affected are activating their plans to deal with the potential impacts and extra staffing and on call arrangements are in place over the festive period.\n\nSEPA have seven flood alerts in place covering Caithness and Sutherland, Dumfries and Galloway, Orkney, Scottish Borders, Shetland, Skye and Lochaber and the Western Isles.\n\nTransport Minister Humza Yousaf said: \u201cMinisters have been receiving regular updates on the impact of the severe weather across this week and I wanted to be at the Traffic Control Centre this morning to monitor preparations for myself.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting the worst of the disruption today when winds are expected to reach 90 mph.\n\n\u201cOur transport operators and trunk road operating companies are working hard to keep services and roads running, safety has to be our top priority so we are seeing delays and cancellations to flights and ferries. There are some alterations to train timetables with full details on the Scotrail website.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen more traditional winter weather with snow and ice on higher roads and our gritters and patrols have been out across the network - our gritter tracker shows where they have been in action. Our TRISS teams are stationed at strategic points on the network and our electronic signing is warning drivers of the likely hazards.\n\n\u201cWe would urge everyone to check the latest sources of information before they travel and keep in mind that the situation can change quickly. They should leave plenty time to get to where they need to be and the transport operators are doing what they can to help people arrive at their destinations and get any last minute festive shopping done safely.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe shall be continuing to monitor the situation over the festive period including Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day to make sure that the most reliable and relevant information is being communicated to people as early as possible.\u201d",

    "text": "It's the holidays, and while the stores are overflowing with every gift imaginable, there are many children who won't have a pile of presents, or any presents, to open on Christmas. So when those children were asked to choose between taking home a gift for themselves or a gift for a loved one, their responses were completely unexpected.\n\nEighty-three percent of the kids who attend the Boys & Girls Club of Metro Atlanta are from low-income families, many of whom can't afford a Christmas tree, let alone presents to put under it. So the folks at UPtv decided to conduct a social experiment in which these children would be asked to choose between a gift for themselves and a gift for someone in their family.\n\nAnd as you can see in the video above, these weren't just any gifts \u2014 they were their dream gifts. The kids were asked what they most wanted for Christmas and what their family member (most often their mom) might want. Then the kids were handed both of those gifts. Can you imagine if a kid who is not expecting a gift this Christmas was given a computer or a Barbie house? And then just a few minutes later they are given the gift that they know will make their mom happy \u2014 a new watch or a coffee machine?.\n\nOf course, the kids are elated. But there is a catch. They can only take one home. And they must decide if it will be the gift they wanted, or the one they chose for a loved one.\n\nWithout fail, these kids chose the gift they picked out for their mom or dad. And while some were understandably disappointed that they wouldn't be getting their dream gift, they were all super excited to give a special gift to someone they love.\n\nThanks for the lesson on the true meaning of Christmas, kids.\n\n(Oh, and by the way, because the kids chose to give rather than to receive, they were given both gifts to take home.)",

Water currents around narrow spots, bridges, inlets and outlets can cause thinner ice. The Coast Guard says stay away from cracks, seams, pressure ridges, slushy areas and darker areas.\n\nIce near the shore of a frozen lake may be unsafe and weaker because of shifting, expansion and sunlight reflecting off the bottom.\n\nA majority of Coast Guard units around Lake Michigan have winterized their rescue boats.

    "text": "Nine out of ten (90 per cent) people in Scotland receive nuisance calls each month according to a recent survey which has also revealed Scotland\u2019s top five nuisance telephone calls of 2016.\n\nThe YouGov survey commissioned by CPR Call Blocker, makers of the best selling call blocking device in the UK, also revealed that almost a fifth (17 per cent) of adults in Scotland have been a victim of a telephone scam.\n\nOf those who have been scammed, over a third (35 per cent) said they had lost between \u00a3100 and \u00a310,000 as a result with four per cent having lost over \u00a310,000.\n\nThe survey also revealed Scotland\u2019s top five nuisance calls of 2016 are:\n\nCalls about PPI refunds (67 per cent) \u2013 being told you are owed money for mis-sold PPI payments and asked for an admin fee to proceed;\n\nCompensations calls (62 per cent) \u2013 being told you are due compensation for a vehicle/work accident and then asked to provide personal details and/or pay an admin fee to proceed;\n\nMissed calls/automated calls scam (58 per cent)- a message asks you to call back a number which is a premium-rate phone line;\n\nMarketing cold-calls (55 per cent) \u2013 receiving unsolicited calls from organisations you\u2019ve had no dealings with, usually trying to sell double glazing or home energy services, who ask for personal information and/or bank details to pay upfront;\n\n(Joint fifth) Pensions and investment scams (14 per cent) \u2013 being told about an \u2018unmissable\u2019 investment opportunity or offered pension liberation or bonuses;\n\nCredit card/loan arranger scam (14 per cent) \u2013 you are invited to apply for a guaranteed loan for an application fee;\n\nAlmost a third (30 per cent) of adults in Scotland are receiving 20 or more unwanted calls in an average month, with 15 per cent receiving 30 or more calls.\n\nKris Hicks of CPR Call Blocker said: \u201cWith nine out of ten people saying they receive unwanted calls each month, scam and nuisance calls continue to be a major problem for people in Scotland and its often the most vulnerable people in society who are falling victim to telephone scams.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning to see the rise in automated messages which makes a first appearance in the top five this year, in at number three. It is also worrying to see the rise in investment opportunity scams which is also new on the top five this year, in joint fifth place. We are hearing about a lot of pension-related investment scams at the moment, and with almost a fifth (18 per cent) of those surveyed being a victim of this type of scam, we predict that, unfortunately, this may well become one of the most prolific scams of 2017.\u201d\n\nCPR Call Blocker commissions the research annually to highlight the scale of unwanted calls across the UK.

    "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A former lottery computer administrator from Iowa and a friend from Texas were charged Thursday in Wisconsin with racketeering and theft by fraud for allegedly rigging a 2007 Megabucks game which paid them more than $780,000.\n\nEddie Tipton, who lived in Iowa and is now listed in court records as having an address in Flatonia, Texas, was charged by the state attorney general's office along with Robert Rhodes of Sugar Land, Texas. Tipton also faces four counts of computer crime. All are felonies.\n\nThe documents allege Tipton, who worked for the Urbandale, Iowa-based Multi-State Lottery Association, modified computer data so he could pick a winning number for the Dec. 29, 2007, Wisconsin Megabucks game. Tipton's job was to write software designed to randomly pick numbers for lottery computers used for various games by 37 state and territorial lotteries.\n\nA state investigator says Rhodes confessed the scheme, explaining that Tipton recruited him to help win jackpots and gave him a series of numbers to play, one of which won the $783,257 jackpot that Rhodes collected and later split with Tipton.\n\nThe Wisconsin criminal complaint said Rhodes told a state investigator that in December 2007 he visited Tipton in Iowa and Tipton provided him with index cards with a series of numbers written on them, telling him that one of the numbers would win.\n\nRhodes said he rented a car, drove to Wisconsin and purchased tickets from various stores around southwest Wisconsin. He said after driving back to Iowa, he flew home to Texas.\n\nRhodes told the investigator that Tipton explained how a file he created in the computers could be activated at will.\n\nHe said Tipton wanted him to play again in December 2010. Rhodes said he did but had second thoughts and feared being caught, so he only played some of the numbers Tipton gave him. He later realized that one of the numbers he didn't play would have won another Megabucks jackpot.\n\nHe said in early 2011 Tipton visited him in Texas and showed him an Iowa Hot Lotto ticket that had hit the $16.5 million jackpot. Tipton told him he was thinking of having his brother, Tommy Tipton, cash it for him but he was concerned that Tommy had already won a 2005 Colorado jackpot. Although Rhodes attempted to get the ticket cashed through people he knew, he wasn't successful because Iowa Lottery officials grew suspicious.\n\nTipton, 53, plans to voluntarily appear to face the charges in mid-February \"and looks forward to defending himself in court,\" said his attorney, Dean Stowers.\n\nRhodes' attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nRhodes and Tipton have known each other since the early 1990s when they were in business together in Texas.\n\nIowa trials are scheduled early next year for Tipton and his 52-year-old brother, Tommy, a former deputy sheriff and justice of the peace in Texas. They'll be tried separately on a charge of ongoing criminal conduct. Eddie Tipton, who was previously convicted of a separate lottery fraud, faces an additional charge of money laundering in Iowa.\n\nTommy Tipton's trial is scheduled for Jan. 23 and Eddie Tipton's is set for Feb. 13.\n\nRhodes, 48, is scheduled to enter into a plea agreement with Iowa prosecutors next month and is expected to testify at the Tiptons' Iowa trials.\n\nEddie Tipton was fired by the Multi-State Lottery Association after he was initially charged with fraud in January 2015 related to the 2010 Iowa Hot Lotto ticket. He was convicted last year on two counts of fraud but one was thrown out by a state appeals court in July.\n\nIowa prosecutor Rob Sand alleges the conspiracy involving the three men netted more than $2 million in winnings from two 2005 Colorado lottery tickets, the 2007 Wisconsin MegaBucks ticket, two 2010 Kansas 2by2 tickets and a 2011 Oklahoma Hot Lotto ticket.\n\nTommy Tipton won the two lottery prizes in Colorado and one in Oklahoma. He convinced friends to cash the tickets for him to remain anonymous.\n\nMark Weinhardt, attorney for Tommy Tipton, filed a motion to dismiss the ongoing criminal conduct charge against him in October, saying the state cannot prove he committed a crime.\n\nBe sure and try our new SNOWCAST APP!

Iman Rahal and her husband Mohammed Salloum from Damascus are two of the refugee chefs that joined the festival, and are happy to have the chance to \u201cshow that Syria is more than just war\u201d, as Rahal puts it. \u201cI want people to know that we have a great culture and wonderful food.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chef Esther Molnar with Syrian chefs Iman Rahal and Mohammed Salloum at La Ruche.\n\nThe menu they come up with for the La Ruche aux Deux Reines, a Strasbourg restaurant that serves food from all over the world, is tantalisingly mouthwatering; fattoush (a salad with fried bread), fatayer (spinach and cheese pie), kibbeh (bulgur balls) and three delicious desserts. The reaction from customers has been overwhelming; \u201cI had to disappoint about 60 customers,\u201d restaurant owner Vicky Djama says. \u201cThere simply isn\u2019t enough space for everybody.\u201d\n\nShe loves the idea of the Refugee Food Festival and jumped at the chance to take part. \u201cI see it as an honour,\u201d she says. \u201cWe serve food from all over the world in our restaurant and I always wanted to know more about Syrian cuisine. But more importantly, we are all concerned about what\u2019s happening in Syria, but we haven\u2019t got a clue when it comes to doing something. For me this is a great opportunity to actually do something: help these refugees to show their talents to the public.\u201d\n\nPlease help us help #childrefugees survive the winter - Guardian/Observer 2016 Appeal Read more\n\nThe festival was the initiative of Parisians Marine Mandrila and Louis Martin, who run a company called Food Sweet Food that specialises in forming connections between people through culinary events, books and documentaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe festival has three objectives,\u201d Marine says. \u2018First of all, we want to change the way people look at refugees. There are all these negative assumptions. We want to show that they are people like you and me, who have skills and talents and can contribute to society. Secondly, we want to introduce unknown cuisines to the French public. And thirdly, we want to help these refugee chefs to integrate and increase their job opportunities.\u201d The initiative has been supported by the UNHCR and the city of Strasbourg.\n\n\n\nFor Iman and Mohammed the festival is an important occasion to introduce themselves to the public. They set up a little Syrian catering service at home a while ago, but hope to begin a real restaurant and are looking for a financier. \u201cA real restaurant is our dream,\u201d says Iman. \u201cBut for now we just hope to make the people who come to the festival very happy.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe has just heard that her sister, who is still in Syria and has applied for asylum in France, has to wait another three months. \u201cAll of our family members are still in Syria, so it\u2019s not going to be a very joyful Christmas for us,\u201d says Mohammed, who used to be an architect and ran a large building company in Syria, but lost everything.\n\n\n\nA few blocks away, in an Italian restaurant, chef Massimo Solinas is working with Dorje, a Tibetan refugee who for safety reasons doesn\u2019t want his last name mentioned. The Italian chef has discovered, to his surprise, that Tibetan cuisine has a dish similar to ravioli, called momo. So he is offering his guests a menu that combines Tibetan momos and Italian ravioli.\n\nThe flamboyant Italian and the quiet Tibetan make an unusual but successful team. The restaurant telephone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing. \u201cI have decided to organise another Tibetan evening in January,\u2019 Solinas says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iman Salloum in the La Ruche kitchens.\n\nThe customers who have been able to get a table are full of praise. An elderly lady who has come with her husband and three grown children says: \u201cWe travelled to India this year where we were introduced to Tibetan food and we really loved it. That was one reason to come. But we are also impressed to eat food that\u2019s cooked by someone who has gone through so much and still has found the strength to share his culture with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe festival offers us a rare opportunity to taste Tibetan food\u201d, says a young man in the back of the restaurant, who came together with three friends. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to expect, but we love it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the food from my village,\u201d Dorje explains. \u201cMy mother taught me how to fold momos which really is an art in itself. She is a great cook and I can\u2019t tell you how much I miss her. Making momos is a way for me to be with her.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWhat is so important to me is that this festival offers me the chance to show that we Tibetans have our own culture and cuisine, contrary to what the Chinese would like you to believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a migrant, just like Dorje,\u201d Solinas says. \u201cThat\u2019s something that connects us. Although our reasons were different, we both left our country. So we both know what it is when you live in one country and all of your family lives somewhere else.\u201d\n\nIn yet another kitchen in the city, Afghan chef Ahmadzai is working hard in the Vietnamese restaurant Mandala. The initial idea was that he would cook for only one evening but the event attracted so much attention that restaurant owner Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Muller asked him back. The dishes Mandala is serving tonight are a fusion of Asian and Afghan elements.\n\n\n\nThe charities supported by the Guardian and Observer 2016 appeal Read more\n\nAhmadzai is afraid to talk to the press, so Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric does the talking. \u201cFor me it\u2019s a natural thing to partake in the festival because my wife is Vietnamese and her parents came to France as refugees. Through them I have seen how difficult it is to find your place in a totally alien country.\u201d\n\nWorking with Ahmadzai is easy, he says, because the Afghan had already gained experience in a Vietnamese restaurant in Norway. \u201cRefugees can enrich our society, but in the media they are depicted as an invasion. I really want to contradict that lie.\u201d\n\nAsked why the festival attracts so many people, his wife Nicole To says: \u201cPeople are curious. They want to try out food they have never tasted before. But I also think many people are genuinely concerned about the fate of refugees. And this is a way to show it.\u201d\n\nLater that evening Ahmadzai introduces himself to the customers with a short speech. \u201cI really want to express my gratitude that you have come to eat my food,\u201d he says. And when the guests give him a loud applause, he smiles.\n\nThe Refugee Food Festival is in Strasbourg until December 23. This month Food Sweet Food is launching a practical toolkit for people who want to organise a refugee food festival in their own city. For more information email contact@foodsweetfood.org\n\nIn June next year Food Sweet Food is planning a European Refugee Food Festival across 10 European cities.",

    "text": "AUSTRALIANS love a good underdog story.\n\nBut can an orphaned mongrel, raised in the Pilbara take a significant bite out of the box office in a bumper weekend dominated by big-budget Hollywood blockbusters such as Rogue One?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare for a distributor to release an Australian film on Boxing Day,\u201d said Joel Pearlman, co-CEO of Roadshow Films.\n\n\u201cThen again, Red Dog: True Blue is a pretty rare film \u2014 sequels to Australian films are quite rare (too).\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Mick (Levi Miller) and Blue offer a homegrown alternative to Hollywood.\n\nIn years gone by, Roadshow reserved the Boxing Day slot for Peter Jackson\u2019s The Lord Of the Rings trilogy.\n\n\u201cThe December/January corridor is traditionally the highest-grossing month of the year, so you need to ensure you have a film that can (stand up) against such a large volume of competitive offerings,\u2019\u2019 said Pearlman.\n\nOnly four other Australian films have braved the Boxing Day slot in the last decade, according to the MPDAA. And two of them \u2014 Happy Feet and Happy Feet Two \u2014 were funded by a big-budget Hollywood studio (Warner Bros, coincidentally distributed in Australia by Roadshow).\n\nRussell Crowe\u2019s The Water Diviner braved the Boxing Day bullpen in 2014 to become a $15.9 million success.\n\nThe Railway Man, a UK/Australian co-production starring Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth, took about half that after releasing at the same time 12 months earlier in an art house counter-programming strategy.\n\nNobody is suggesting Red Dog: True Blue can wield enough box office clout to even temporarily disable Rogue One\u2019s shield.\n\nBut exhibitors are quietly confident the prequel to the breakout 2011 hit based on Louis de Bernieres\u2019 novel can match its predecessor\u2019s $21.5 million box office haul, which makes it one of the Top 10 highest-earning Australian films of all time.\n\n\u201cRed Dog was an enormous success with the Australian public and we thought Boxing Day was absolutely the right day to be able to provide an alternative to a lot of the American cinema that opens around that corridor,\u201d said Pearlman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a genuine Australian choice for Australian families over that period.\u201d\n\nReuniting producer Nelson Woss with director Kriv Stenders, the prequel stars a natural born show dog by the name of Phoenix (Koko, the original Red Dog, died in 2012 of heart disease) and Pan\u2019s Levi Miller (as 11-year-old Mick.)\n\nTrue Blue, however, faces stiff competition from a particularly strong and diverse range of Boxing Day releases.\n\nLEIGH PAATSCH: WHAT TO SEE AT THE MOVIES RIGHT NOW\n\nmedia_camera Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) will put up a fight. Picture: Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story, which took more than $14 million when it opened last weekend, is still in hyper drive.\n\nDisney\u2019s animated musical adventure, Moana, is probably Red Dog\u2019s most immediate threat in the hard-fought family market.\n\nSing, a toe-tapping, animated jukebox musical starring Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon and Scarlett Johansson, is also a strong candidate in this field.\n\nAdult audiences are just as well catered for.\n\nLa La Land, a throwback to the Hollywood musicals of the 1940s and \u201950s, is already shaping up as an Oscars favourite.\n\nmedia_camera Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) in a scene from film La La Land. Picture: Dale Robinette\n\nSet in modern day Los Angeles and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as two dreamers who fall in love, the film has been nominated for seven Golden Globe awards.\n\nRobert Zemeckis (Cast Away) directs Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard in Allied, a romantic WWII epic set in Morocco and London.\n\nmedia_camera David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike challenge racial prejudice in A United Kingdom.\n\nA United Kingdom will appeal to a similar demographic.\n\nSet in 1947 and based on a true story, the film stars David Oyelowo as Seretse Khama, the future king of Botswana, and Rosamund Pike as the London clerk he married despite vehement opposition from both families and the threats from the governments of England and South Africa.\n\nBryan Cranston teams up with James Franco for Why Him? a broad comedy about an overprotective father who tries to dissuade his daughter from marrying her strangely disinhibited fiance.\n\nThe Edge of Seventeen, a critically-acclaimed coming-of-age dramedy starring Hailee Steinfeld and Woody Harrelson, has advance previews this weekend.\n\nArt house audiences won\u2019t be disappointed either. Jim Jarmusch\u2019s observational drama Paterson, starring Adam Driver, opens on Boxing Day alongside the heartwarming French comedy Rosalie Blum.\n\nOriginally published as Will Red Dog nip at the Empire",

    "text": "Nine out of ten (90 per cent) people in Scotland receive nuisance calls each month according to a recent survey which has also revealed Scotland\u2019s top five nuisance telephone calls of 2016.\n\nThe YouGov survey commissioned by CPR Call Blocker, makers of the best selling call blocking device in the UK, also revealed that almost a fifth (17 per cent) of adults in Scotland have been a victim of a telephone scam.\n\nOf those who have been scammed, over a third (35 per cent) said they had lost between \u00a3100 and \u00a310,000 as a result with four per cent having lost over \u00a310,000.\n\nThe survey also revealed Scotland\u2019s top five nuisance calls of 2016 are:\n\nCalls about PPI refunds (67 per cent) \u2013 being told you are owed money for mis-sold PPI payments and asked for an admin fee to proceed;\n\nCompensations calls (62 per cent) \u2013 being told you are due compensation for a vehicle/work accident and then asked to provide personal details and/or pay an admin fee to proceed;\n\nMissed calls/automated calls scam (58 per cent)- a message asks you to call back a number which is a premium-rate phone line;\n\nMarketing cold-calls (55 per cent) \u2013 receiving unsolicited calls from organisations you\u2019ve had no dealings with, usually trying to sell double glazing or home energy services, who ask for personal information and/or bank details to pay upfront;\n\n(Joint fifth) Pensions and investment scams (14 per cent) \u2013 being told about an \u2018unmissable\u2019 investment opportunity or offered pension liberation or bonuses;\n\nCredit card/loan arranger scam (14 per cent) \u2013 you are invited to apply for a guaranteed loan for an application fee;\n\nAlmost a third (30 per cent) of adults in Scotland are receiving 20 or more unwanted calls in an average month, with 15 per cent receiving 30 or more calls.\n\nKris Hicks of CPR Call Blocker said: \u201cWith nine out of ten people saying they receive unwanted calls each month, scam and nuisance calls continue to be a major problem for people in Scotland and its often the most vulnerable people in society who are falling victim to telephone scams.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning to see the rise in automated messages which makes a first appearance in the top five this year, in at number three. It is also worrying to see the rise in investment opportunity scams which is also new on the top five this year, in joint fifth place. We are hearing about a lot of pension-related investment scams at the moment, and with almost a fifth (18 per cent) of those surveyed being a victim of this type of scam, we predict that, unfortunately, this may well become one of the most prolific scams of 2017.\u201d\n\nCPR Call Blocker commissions the research annually to highlight the scale of unwanted calls across the UK.

    "title": "Cleveland Cavaliers: 7 Possible Trade Candidates",
    "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers have several holes in their depth chart, and a trade could be on the horizon, so here are seven possible trade candidates for them.\n\nChris \u201cBirdman\u201d Andersen, he\u2019s done from he season. J.R. Smith, he\u2019s out for the foreseeable future. Mo Williams, he\u2019s not coming back. Several key members of this Cleveland Cavaliers team have gone down, and they may need to salvage their championship hopes with a trade. Here\u2019s a perfect example of a brilliant trade for Ricky Rubio that the Cavaliers may venture to look into.\n\nA team with LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love will always, barring some superhuman acts, make the Finals among the Eastern Conference teams, but it will be one of these player that fills a much needed gap that pushes Cleveland to the next level against the Golden State in the Finals trilogy that is expected.\n\nCleveland has several needs right now. They need a backup point guard to help Kyrie Irving. They have Kay Felder on the roster, but his 5\u20199\u2033 frame has made it hard for him to produce as a constant back up point guard. At the same time, the loss of Chris Andersen opens up a need for a backup center and rim protector, and J.R. Smith\u2019s injury could beg the Cavaliers to bring in a combo guard.\n\nWant your voice heard? Join the King James Gospel team!\n\nThe Cavaliers management has never been shy of bringing in big name players to help them in their championship quest. With that said, here are seven players that could be cheaply bought for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nCandidate #1- Will Barton: Combo Guard\n\nJust coming from a Nugg Love, FanSided\u2019s Denver Nuggets site, I know the importance of Will Barton to the Denver Nuggets. Several rumors have gone around about his trade availability, and it seems that he could be on the move, but it would not be cheap.\n\nBarton has quickly found a home in Denver after being traded their a couple of seasons ago. Last season Barton averaged 28.7 minutes per game, and that has gone up to 30.7 minutes per game as Denver has seen several key injuries.\n\nWith a healthy and youthful Denver team, Will Barton may go back to averaging just 20-25 minutes per game. His production and versatility are key factors that would make Cleveland crave him. The 6\u20196\u2033, 25 year old small forward averaged 14.4 points per game off of the Nuggets bench and received several votes for Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nThe problem with obtaining Barton is that he would be a more expensive option. The Nuggets may ask for several picks along with the Cavaliers youth such as McRae or Felder. The Cavaliers have been know to trade picks in the past couple seasons, but they may have better places to look before settling on a big trade for Barton.\n\nProbability: 5-15%\n\nCandidate #2- Jahlil Okafor: Center\n\nIn recent days, the 76ers dilemma has been unfolding in a way many would not have guessed. Nerlens Noel may be the safe one and Jahlil Okafor could be on his way out after Joel Embiid called Noel his \u201cbest friend.\u201d\n\nThe struggle for Cleveland is that they do not need another scoring big, but for the right price, they may take one. If a poor quality first rounder and a player like Jordan McRae or DeAndre Liggins would be enough for Okafor, why wouldn\u2019t Cleveland make that happen.\n\nBesides Love and James, the Cleveland Cavaliers do not have a true post scorer. Okafor would be a solid, not perfect, fit in Cleveland. He would be put in the second unit. With the like of Shumpert, Jefferson, and Frye in that unit, he may be able to post up at will.\n\nHis scoring could be used in the second unit. His defensive incapablity are what would drive the Cavaliers away from him. Noel would be the perfect target if available.\n\nPossibility: 0%-10%\n\nCandidate #3- Sergio Rodriguez: Point Guard\n\nIn a recent article by Quenton Albertie, he wrote this regarding what Rodriguez could bring to the Cavaliers.\n\n\u201cIf the Cleveland Cavaliers want a veteran point guard that can get a bench full of specialists involved, they need to look no further than Sergio Rodriguez.\u201d\n\nThat description of Rodriguez is exactly what Cleveland needs. They need a steady, consistent backup point guard that they could get cheap. Cheap is a relative term, and it is hard to gauge what Philly would want for him especially with Ben Simmons return on the horizon.\n\nRodriguez has averaged 8.8 points per game and 6.1 assist per game in his 27 games as a 76er. Sergio has proved his worth this season after being out of the NBA for two season. Although he is relatively inefficient, Sergio has shown he can hit from deep. He has shot the three ball at 35.1%, and if Ben Simmons return moves him back to the bench, the 76ers may entertain an offer.\n\nThis trade would happen later in the season, and it would be quite a solid move for this Cavaliers team.\n\nPossibility: 5%-15%\n\nCandidate #4- Ricky Rubio: Point Guard\n\nRicky Rubio is almost the same type of player as Sergio Rodriguez just with a bit better playmaking and a bit less shooting ability.\n\nWith the Timberwolves noticeably moving towards the future with three key starters under 22, it seems that the time with 26 year-old Rubio may quickly be coming to an end. But that is not to say that Rubio is not still a skilled player.\n\nThis season, in his current role, Rubio has yet to be his usual self. He has averaged a career-low 7.1 points per game and a career-low 6.9 turnovers per game. With both Tyus Jones (20) and Kris Dunn (22) available to take his minutes, there is no more need for him in the tundra of Minnesota.\n\nFor that reason, Cleveland may be able to buy-low on a position that they will eventually need, and the always pass-first Rubio may be the fix. Ever since the Mo Williams situation, the Cleveland backup point guard position has not been the same, but could a youthful McRae and a first change that.\n\nBecause McRae and a first would honestly be all it should take to take Rubio off of the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves. Honestly, I find a trade like that to be beneficial for both sides. Even potentially add Shumpert in there to entice the Wolves, and now there is a good trade.\n\nPossibility: 15%-25%\n\nCandidate #5- Kosta Koufos: Center\n\nAt this point, it is a mix of the Sacramento Kings wanting to unjam their front court, and the Cavaliers need for another front court presence.\n\nAfter Chris Andersen went down, the position opened for Tristan Thompson\u2019s backup. With TT playing 29.0 minutes per game, his highest since the 2013-2014 season, he will eventually need more break time, and Andersen was the one to give him that.\n\nNow the Cavaliers, instead of just marching through, would attempt to find a cheap replacement, and Kosta Koufos, while a solid player, is certainly not the future for the Sacramento Kings. Koufos has averaged 10.5 points and 10.6 rebounds per 36 minutes this season, but due to the overloaded Kings front court, he has only played 19.9 minutes per game.\n\nThe only perk that is seriously enticing about Koufos is his cost. While several of these players have been high quality places, Koufos maintains a low-rep and could easily be shipped.\n\nPossibility: 10%-20%\n\nCandidate #6- Deron Williams: Point Guard\n\nThis is another situation of an aging point guard that can still contribute, and a team that could use his services. Deron Williams, while he has not been the same for quite some time, could still prove vital as a member of the Cavaliers.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks are currently sitting at 8-21 and tied for last in the Western Conference. Sooner or later, they will look to empty some of their veterans in search of the future. While the Cavaliers are not loaded with extravagant picks or young alluring pieces, they do have enough to get this aging point guard.\n\nWilliams is also a free agent next season, so he would most likely be a player to stay in Cleveland and continue to help bring in championships. The asking price for Williams should not be much. Jordan McRae, who has been a nonessential part of the Cavaliers team this far in the season, could be the bargaining chip.\n\nA second rounder and McRae could lure the Mavericks into this offer. It is unclear if the Cavaliers would be this certain to fill this backup point guard role immediately, but if they are, Deron could be the main to target.\n\nPossibility: 15%-20%\n\nCandidate #7- Monta Ellis: Combo Guard\n\nMonta Ellis and the Indiana Pacers have not clicked like Larry Bird and the upper management had hoped for. With the Pacers currently under .500 at 15-16, movement among this team could happen sooner rather than later.\n\nWith Monta being a much bigger name than the aforementioned players, it would take more for the Cavaliers to bait the Pacers into a trade. Players like Iman Shumpert, Jordan McRae, Channing Frye, and possible a couple other name could circle around trades for Ellis if provoked.\n\nOutside of his rookie season, Monta Ellis is averaging a career-low in points and assists. It is not slump, and it is not a coincidence. Monta Ellis has underperformed alongside Paul George, Jeff Teague, and Myles Turner, therefore it may be time to cut ties.\n\nThis would be a big time trade that the Cavaliers could pull off that would certainly impact their Finals chances even after J.R. Smith returns.\n\nPossibility: 10%-15%\n\nIs it time for the Cavaliers to make a move and if so, for who? Tell us who you think the Cavaliers should target in wake of all these recent injuries.\n\nThis article originally appeared on",

(AP) Duke suspended Grayson Allen indefinitely from the team, one day after he was caught tripping an opponent for the third time in a year.\n\nIn a brief statement announcing the suspension, coach Mike Krzyzewski said the program \u201dneeded to take further steps regarding his actions that do not meet the standards of Duke basketball.\u201d\n\nAtlantic Coast Conference Commissioner John Swofford issued a statement supporting the move, calling sportsmanship \u201done of the core values of our league\u201d and adding that the suspension \u201ddemonstrates adherence to this important principle.\u201d\n\nHOCKEY\n\nSUNRISE, Fla. (AP) \u2013 Jaromir Jagr moved into sole possession of second place on the NHL career scoring list when the Florida Panthers forward got an assist in the third period of a 3-1 loss to the Boston Bruins.\n\nJagr got point No. 1,888 to break a tie with Mark Messier. Aleksander Barkov was credited with the goal that deflected off the 44-year-old Czech star.\n\nOnly Wayne Gretzky, with 2,857 points, has more than Jagr. In a video, Gretzky offered congratulations. The game was stopped for a celebration, and Jagr came onto the ice to accept a commemorative golden stick from the Panthers.\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2013 David Legwand announced his retirement, ending a 16-year NHL career that began as the Nashville Predators\u2019 first draft pick.\n\nThe 36-year-old Legwand had 228 goals and 390 assists in 1,136 career regular-season games with Nashville, Detroit, Ottawa and Buffalo.

The deal includes a club option for 2020 that, if exercised, would make it worth $80 million over four years.\n\nThe agreement is contingent upon Encarnacion passing a physical, two people familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the team had not made an announcement.\n\nOne of baseball\u2019s most feared power hitters, Encarnacion had 42 home runs and 127 RBIs last season for the Toronto Blue Jays, who lost to Cleveland in the AL Championship Series.\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2013 A person with knowledge of the deal said pitcher Ivan Nova and the Pittsburgh Pirates agreed to a $26 million, three-year contract.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement had not been announced.\n\nPittsburgh acquired Nova from the New York Yankees at the Aug. 1 trade deadline.

    "text": "Fife households are likely to see their council tax bills rise for the first time in a decade as the local authority seeks to close a budget gap of more than \u00a330 million.\n\nAnd cuts in spending could also lead to up to 300 job losses at Fife Council.\n\nCouncil leader David Ross said although a final decision was yet to be taken, an increase in council tax bills of three per cent was \u201calmost inevitable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been figuring that into our calculations anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t raise it, we\u2019re looking at making another \u00a34.6 million of cuts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d already been planning around \u00a330 million, but the latest figure now following the budget is that we\u2019ll have to make around \u00a333m worth of cuts.\n\n\u201cMost of that is due to a reduction in our grant from the Scottish Government.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is still checking going on, I think we\u2019re going to lose around \u00a326 million in grant. The rest of that gap is due to costs going up and an increase in demand for services.\n\n\u201cI mean, in home care, they are telling me this year we have seen a 27 per cent increase in home care packages. So it\u2019s not just about the grant, although that is the biggest part of it.\u201d\n\nCllr Ross pointed out there were two elements to potential council tax rises. There is the option councils have to raise it by up to three per cent, and then there have been changes to the bands at the top level.\n\nHe said some households were likely to see a significant increase in their bills because of the second element, although the Scottish Government has insisted there will be \u201ctargeted relief\u201d for those on low incomes affected by the changes.\n\nHowever, Cllr Ross added: \u201cThe worry I have is because it\u2019s a bill coming from the council, we\u2019ll get the blame when it\u2019s actually being imposed by the Scottish Government.\n\n\u201cAlthough we collect the money and send out the bills, we have absolutely no control over that at all.\u201d\n\nHe said he hoped all political parties would work together on this year\u2019s budget, and said all parties had been \u201cround the table\u201d.\n\n\u201cLast year, we agreed on something like 98 per cent of the budget, and then it fell apart. This year, with the elections in May, it is more important that everyone is round the table because we don\u2019t know who is going to be taking over in May.\n\n\u201cDespite all the national noise and what some people are saying, I\u2019m still very seriously hopeful that we will form part of the administration. I think there is every chance that we will do that, but you can\u2019t predict elections, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nCllr Ross also stressed every effort would be made to keep job reductions to a minimum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to make any real predictions but the top line figure we\u2019ve been told for this year by officers is around 300,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, that depends on the decisions we actually make at budget time.\n\n\u201cAs always we are doing our best to protect jobs because in the long run that protects services.\u201d",

    "title": "Tom Savage Isn't Typical First-Time Starter for Playoff Hopeful Houston Texans",
    "text": "Tom Savage will stare down a long list of looming and daunting questions Saturday night. Then he'll either be engulfed by them or put out fires one at a time.\n\nHe's the Houston Texans' starting quarterback now after the Brock Osweiler experiment mercifully reached its messy conclusion. There's no brighter stage to make your first career start nearly three full seasons after being a mid-round pick (135th overall in 2014).\n\nSavage will be responsible for keeping the Texans' playoff hopes afloat as they enter Week 16 still leading the AFC South, but only because of a tiebreaker with the Tennessee Titans. Both teams have identical 8-6 records, and the Indianapolis Colts are just one game back.\n\nHe'll be playing under the searing prime-time lights against the Cincinnati Bengals, a team that's struggled all season but still employs a defensive tackle who can gobble up quarterbacks. Geno Atkins is tied for the league lead among all interior defensive linemen with eight sacks, according to Pro Football Focus, and is second with 65 pressures.\n\nAnd he'll be doing it all on Christmas Eve, a time when family and football blend together seamlessly to put more scrutinizing eyes on a quarterback who's attempted just 55 career regular-season passes.\n\nSavage likely won't be functioning at warp speed, though, because that's not his style. It's not how football has shaped him. You can't take the long, winding road of his career at high speeds.\n\nHis performance Saturday night will be a product of that journey and the hurdles jumped by a 26-year-old who didn't find his college football home until the third try. Now, after suffering two injuries and then being pushed aside by the Texans' free-agency splash at his position, it's finally Savage's turn.\n\nHe's a bargain compared to Brock Osweiler, as ESPN Stats & Information noted. But the size of his paycheck has little bearing on what really matters: stepping into a game that doubles as a rattling washing machine and having the maturity beyond his years to handle the weight of the moment.\n\nTom Savage replaces Brock Osweiler.\n\n\n\nSavage has $300,584 guaranteed in his current deal\n\n\n\nOsweiler has $37,000,000 guaranteed in his deal \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) December 18, 2016\n\nTo understand Savage and why he's more experienced than his game logs let on we have to travel back in time, briefly stopping at three schools.\n\nOur first stop is 2009, when Savage was a freshman starter at Rutgers. He was reliably solid and showed quality vision with just seven interceptions all season alongside 14 touchdown throws. Savage was also named a freshman All-American and his future looked bright.\n\nThen that flame quickly flickered and faded. Savage suffered a hand injury early in 2010 that eventually cost him his starting job at Rutgers. He went from a highly touted recruit to being a castoff and needing to sit out a season after transferring to Arizona.\n\nA year of critical development time without game action went by, and Savage still couldn't find permanent footing. He transferred once more after Arizona hired Rich Rodriguez as its new head coach. Yet again he had to sit for a season, and yet again his draft stock and future took a roundhouse kick to the gut.\n\nThat's when he arrived at the University of Pittsburgh and came under the watch of then-quarterbacks coach Brooks Bollinger. Immediately it was clear to Bollinger that, despite all the mental beatings Savage had taken while going from prized recruit to repeatedly discarded, he still had the physical tools to be an NFL quarterback.\n\n\"He had an NFL arm and could make any throw on the field,\" Bollinger told Bleacher Report. \"He's a big guy, but has enough athletic ability to be considered athletic for his size. He has good feet, and can be elusive enough for that to be a strength in the pocket. He has a quick release, too.\"\n\nHis filled physical toolbox hasn't gone anywhere even after almost zero meaningful NFL snaps prior to a Week 15 relief appearance against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The 6'4\" and 230-pound passer leaned on his powerful arm plenty when he was inserted midway through the second quarter. A 13-0 deficit with the Texans' playoff hopes perilously dangling then turned into a 21-20 win over Jacksonville. Savage completed 63.9 percent of his pass attempts for 260 yards at an average of 7.2 yards per throw.\n\nIn a sense there were two victories on the day: the critical one on the scoreboard, and the Texans' best offensive player regaining relevance.\n\nWide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has a rare combination of speed and spider-like hands to reel in balls that descend from all angles as he contorts his body. Yet he was an afterthought with Osweiler under center.\n\nDeAndre Hopkins suddenly matters again Week(s) Catches Yards Week 15 8 87 Weeks 1-14 (avg) 4.6 53.9 Source: NFL.com\n\nIn addition to reviving Hopkins, Savage has demonstrated an ability to be careful while processing the speed of NFL defenses. He didn't throw an interception against the Jaguars and also went interception-free throughout the preseason on 65 attempts.\n\nThat care is a product of Savage's more important set of tools as he enters a pressure cooker Saturday night. The tools that are hidden and not easy to quantify. But they're always present after he learned three different offenses in college before even setting foot in an NFL facility and had success with two different sets of receivers at Rutgers and Pittsburgh.\n\nHe's mentally hardened and able to adapt, which may be his greatest skill of all now as a career-defining moment arrives.\n\n\"I think there's an internal confidence after being battle-tested,\" Bollinger said. \"He's failed and succeeded on big stages before, and in very public ways. When you transfer twice and go through what he went thought it'll do one of two things: It'll either make you crumble, or make you stronger.\"\n\n\"I think it's made him stronger, and given him a greater ability to handle some of the stresses of the position more so than a lot of guys who are young in their careers.\"\n\nThere's nothing normal about Savage.\n\nHe didn't take a standard path to the NFL. And once he arrived the Pennsylvania native lost another year of crucial grooming time after landing on injured reserve due to a shoulder issue in 2015.\n\nNow when clearly evident physical traits\u2014which led Bleacher Report's Chris Simms to call Savage a \"better pure thrower\" than Osweiler\u2014are combined with mental maturity beyond his 26 years, the seeds for something extremely rare could be planted.\n\nHouston is about to shake up the playoff picture and it's all thanks to QB Tom Savage pic.twitter.com/LXdpeWZmlW \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) December 19, 2016\n\nThe Texans might surge after a mid-December change at football's most pivotal position and shake up the AFC playoff picture. How? Through a top-ranked defense, a running back in Lamar Miller who has recorded four 100-plus yard rushing games and the arrival of quarterback competence.\n\nAll that is encouraging, and gives Texans fans hope that they'll trade sugar plums dancing in their heads when they hit the hay on Christmas Eve for thoughts of a home playoff game. But there's a catch, because there's always a catch.\n\nAlthough his long football journey will help because of the mental toughness he's acquired, nothing can ever simulate what Savage is stepping into Saturday.\n\nThere will be no dipping a toe into NFL starting quarterback waters. Instead he'll cannonball right into raging rapids.\n\nSavage hasn't started a regular-season game at any level since 2013, when Bollinger\u2014who said the speed adjustment from college to the NFL is \"like going from flying a prop plane to a fighter jet\"\u2014was working with him.\n\nBollinger knows the feeling of being pushed into a difficult situation. He dealt with that during his own career when, like Savage, he was a backup for most of his time in the NFL. Bollinger made 10 starts over five seasons, nine of which came with the New York Jets in 2005.\n\nThe advice he had for his former student amounts to the time-tested \"KISS\" principle. And above all, trust yourself.\n\n\"You have to keep it as simple as you can,\" Bollinger said. \"You have to continually simplify your thought process. And then the biggest and most difficult thing is trusting your preparation.\"\n\nThere's another person connected to Savage's last season as a starter who may have even more knowledge of the quarterback's mental makeup. That person will be on the other sideline Saturday night.\n\nJustin K. Aller/Getty Images Savage finished his one and only season as Pittsburgh's starter with 2,958 yards, 21 touchdowns and nine interceptions.\n\n\"When I played with him he always handled pressure well,\" said Tyler Boyd, who was Savage's primary receiver in 2013 and led Pitt with 1,174 receiving yards. \"And now coming into the league he should be able to manage it. He has a couple years under his belt with time to mature and develop in all the areas he needed to improve.\"\n\nBoyd, who was the Bengals' second-round pick in 2016, said he connected with Savage immediately.\n\n\"He believed in me, and I believed in him,\" Boyd said. \"It was like we had been playing with each other for years.\"\n\nThere's precedent then at several stops for a situation when Savage slides in and the link between quarterback and receiver was seamless. That happened at Rutgers during one season, and again between Boyd and Savage in Pittsburgh.\n\nNow the Texans are hoping for another instant click. And, like Boyd, they believe he's ready after several years of seasoning in the same system while surrounded by familiar faces.\n\n\"To be honest, I felt that he had the opportunity and knew he would get drafted, but I didn't think he was quite ready to be a starting quarterback his first or second year,\" Boyd added. \"So that's why it's good that he's had time to mature, develop, pick up on game speed and build chemistry with his guys. So now I feel that he's more than ready. And I doubt he's feeling much pressure.\"\n\nTime and experience. Savage has collected the latter in abundance as the former kept ticking and his career detoured around different obstacles.\n\nNow he's stopped at another destination and another milestone. And he'll arrive there Saturday as a quarterback who doesn't look or think like your typical first-time starter.\n\nThe Texans hope that will keep him from being swallowed whole by the moment. And Savage hopes this next opportunity isn't another fleeting one that will quickly be gone.",

    "title": "How Zuckerberg became Fortune's businessperson of the year",
    "text": "He had to buy his way into the mobile domain. Next was a fundamental misunderstanding of the India market. And then, this year: fake news. A critic might ask if that was one misstep too many for Mark Zuckerberg to earn Fortune\u2019s businessperson of the year.\n\nA better question might be: is a misstep really a misstep when it connects to a vision?\n\nI make no claim to cataloging the quality of Facebook\u2019s every move or to being an expert on its CEO. But my own research and experience support this portrait of successful leadership: the quintessential engineer transcending the technological domain to excel in the interdisciplinary aspects of enterprise.\n\nOr, genius coder turns business genius.\n\nIt\u2019s no small feat. But why is that? Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s often cited \u201cconsistency of vision\u201d is surely a factor but consistency is hardly a unique trait in the engineering community. Precise by nature or by training, engineers do tend to stick to their guns.\n\nThe most successful ones, however, discover a need to escape their technical paradigm. Where once they made technology improvements based on their own parameters -- like speed, or a very cool, complicated algorithm -- those on their way up have learned to anticipate how the customer values those functionalities.\n\nThey ask themselves: how do I prioritize and strategize my technology roadmap early and in a way that\u2019s infused with what the market needs -- even when that leads, as it often does, to a different feature set or a different kind of a product. In essence, ascending technical professionals have learned a new kind of flexibility.\n\nThey must think about products and decisions from the point of view of a salesperson. Or anticipate how other functions in the organization might look at the same problem or how those groups will be impacted by their decisions or products. Their challenge, then, is to make sure their technical priorities consider or respond to a broader set of issues and considerations.\n\nAt a higher level, it\u2019s one thing for an entrepreneur to say from the start, \u201cI\u2019m not here to build a great company just to sell it. I\u2019m here for the long haul.\u201d It\u2019s another for that same leader to have the flexibility and wisdom to step back, shift course, and say, \u201cI\u2019m okay with achieving my long-term goals in a different way than I might have originally imagined.\u201d\n\nRemaining true to a vision and having the flexibility to consider alternative viewpoints is where leaders like Mark Zuckerberg establish their singularity.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that, in some ways, he is better at being flexible than most. For example, upon realizing he was late to the mobile game, this talented hacker and engineer was not shy to pay for other innovations that someone else built. And pay handsomely. Was that a misstep?\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s vision is to give the whole world access to information and help humanity to share it. In the case of mobile, maybe it\u2019s obvious that he should have jumped in sooner. But managing that buy vs. build decision demonstrated a great use of flexible thinking to achieve his grand vision. When a leader is always evaluating decisions against an unwavering vision, it may lead to unexpected steps.\n\nMoving into 2017, for example, Zuckerberg\u2019s reversal on fake news -- from abdicating responsibility to aggressively battling misinformation -- may ultimately be viewed a business-killing misstep or a strategic one fulfilling his unwavering vision. Whether that is answered in the short- or long-term remains to be seen.\n\nTo consistently stick to a mission means more than choosing what you are going to do. It\u2019s just as important to say what you\u2019re not going to do. How the handling of misinformation plays out in Facebook\u2019s vision to help people \u201cstay connected, discover what's going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them\u201d will become more apparent in what\u2019s sure to be watershed year for information, technology and business leadership.\n\nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

    "title": "James Taylor: Ex-Nottinghamshire and England batsman reflects on the year his career ended",
    "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device 'It made me realise I'm not invincible'\n\nThe very thing that almost killed former Nottinghamshire and England batsman James Taylor also saved his life.\n\nAnd as he looks back on the year when his career as a professional sportsman came to an abrupt end at the age of 26, he admits to being \"very, very lucky\".\n\nTaylor's heart was beating at 265 beats per minute for six hours. Most people would have passed out in around 10 minutes.\n\n\"Thankfully I was so fit I could withstand it. Six hours is a good effort,\" he told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\n\"It's ironic, that because I am so fit and did so much exercise it ultimately saved me. It's a funny one.\"\n\nTaylor's heart condition - Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) - gets worse with exercise, but had never been diagnosed until he felt ill during pre-season with Nottinghamshire in April.\n\nRetirement was inevitable, and the internal defibrillator he had fitted two months later has already saved his life for a second time.\n\n\"My operation was not to make anything better,\" he said. \"This condition can't get better, but if something goes wrong it is a safety net.\n\n\"If it happens again - and it has - it certainly did its job. It gave me a massive shock. But it did its job.\"\n\n'My best and last moment in cricket'\n\nTaylor played seven Tests for England, including all four matches in last winter's series win over South Africa\n\nTaylor treasures the memories of what proved to be his farewell to international cricket.\n\nHe played in all four matches in last winter's series win over South Africa, taking two stunning catches in the brilliant third Test victory in Johannesburg.\n\n\"Who would have thought my best moment in cricket was my last moment in cricket?\" said Taylor, who won seven Test caps in all.\n\n\"All I wanted in my career was to play for England and I had fought so hard and there had been so many ups and downs. I felt I should have played far more than I did.\n\n\"Then it was all taken away from me. It kind of summed up my career. I got there and it got taken away from me.\n\n\"The best moment I have ever had in my life was one of the last days playing cricket for England, catching those catches in Joburg, winning that game with England, playing for your country amongst some great guys.\n\n\"It doesn't get much better than that. I achieved it, but I just did it less than I imagined and hoped. But I can't complain.\"\n\n'Lucky' to be alive\n\nJames Taylor posted on social media shortly after news of his retirement was announced\n\nTaylor does not complain because he is still alive, but the stubbornness which underpinned his cricket career very nearly led to his demise when he knew all was not well playing for Notts against university side Cambridge MCCU in April.\n\n\"It was very lucky a few things happened,\" the ex-Leicestershire player said, recounting the sequence of events and \"what ifs\" that led to his diagnosis.\n\n\"I am lucky I have a girlfriend for starters - in a lot of ways! I am lucky that Jose was off work and I rang her to say I was ill.\n\n\"And if I hadn't forgotten my keys for my house I wouldn't have got my mum involved. She found me curled up in a ball. If she hadn't come, I wouldn't have got in my house and I don't know what I would have done.\n\n\"Then I didn't listen to my mum in terms of going to hospital, but Jose drove two-and-a-half hours from Shropshire to see if I was all right. She realised things weren't all right and made me go to to hospital in the end. If she wasn't off work then things might have been very different.\"\n\n'My heart was going crazy'\n\nTaylor's health continues to be monitored constantly\n\nTaylor spent almost three weeks in hospital and the \"incredible\" NHS staff saved his life - of that he has no doubt.\n\nHe was rushed in after being sick and was quickly hooked up to various machines, but the memory of hearing his heart pounding will stay with him forever.\n\n\"The sound was the worst thing,\" he explained. \"Hearing how fast my heart was going was a crazy thing and I needed it to stop. Luckily I was in great hands.\"\n\nHis heart withstood the equivalent of running five marathons in six hours.\n\n\"The City hospital and the QMC in Nottingham were phenomenal,\" he added. \"The doctors and nurses were outstanding. They acted so quickly.\"\n\nA million Tweets an hour\n\nTaylor said the social media response after being diagnosed with the heart condition was \"overwhelming\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't for social media,\" Taylor admitted.\n\nDealing with his situation became significantly easier thanks to the support he received from \"hundreds and thousands of people\" who contacted him saying his stoicism was a big inspiration.\n\n\"As a professional cricketer you distance yourself. You don't read everything because it can mess with your head,\" he added.\n\n\"I was in hospital for a week before anybody knew about it. I had 26 million tweets to me, about me, in the first two hours of the news coming out and it got to 60 million in 24 hours - which is phenomenal.\n\n\"The positivity coming my way was like I had died. It was overwhelming. It took me four days to reply to every single direct message, Whatsapp and email. I can't thank the public enough.\n\n\"I dread to think where I would be mentally if that support wasn't there.\"\n\nNot looking back and giving something back\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Batting tips from James Taylor\n\nWith his cricket dreams dismantled overnight, Taylor cried - a lot.\n\nBut having the positivity to recognise and seize new opportunities, he has taken on plenty of media work and a coaching role at the Notts academy - and he is relishing both.\n\n\"I have always tried to be as positive as I can and I have kept that way of thinking,\" Taylor said. \"I am really as happy as I can be.\n\n\"Yes, I am not playing cricket and doing what I love, but now I can gradually do a little bit more exercise and am loving the coaching and media work.\n\n\"Coaching is helping people and giving back what I learnt as a player.\n\n\"I want to see what they can achieve and have an impact. I only want to do things I do enjoy but also, most importantly, where I can make a difference to people. I feel I can make a difference with the coaching.\"\n\nNew perspective\n\nEnforced retirement and a change in career was not what he wanted, of course. The transition from player to coach and pundit has gone pretty well, partly because Taylor always tried to be grounded.\n\n\"That day in Cambridge proved that I am tougher than I thought I was,\" he said.\n\n\"Battling through something that you are not meant to battle through is quite satisfying in a mad kind of way. It has changed my life dramatically. I have met people and spoken to people I never would have spoken to.\n\nInspired to try cricket? Find out how to get into cricket with our inclusive guide.\n\n\"Ultimately I am still here and it has given me a whole new perspective on life.\n\n\"I think it's 80% of these cases are found in post-mortems. That is the only way it is detected and it is too late by then.\n\n\"But luckily my heart and body did its job. I have been very lucky but also very unlucky in lots of ways - but I cannot dwell on what could have happened.\n\n\"I have battled through that moment and most importantly, mentally I am in a good frame of mind. I can't control what's going on physically, but mentally I am in a good space.\"\n\nWedding bells\n\nTaylor's fiancee Josephine Naylor has been part of fundraising efforts for the British Heart Foundation\n\nHe has also found time to plan a wedding. Well, part-plan a wedding for next summer.\n\nProposing to Josephine had been in the offing for some time.\n\n\"That wasn't just a knee-jerk reaction,\" Taylor said. \"I'm sure people think that but it's been a long time coming\n\n\"I bought the ring a few months before this happened. I am not having a lot to do with the wedding thankfully, so hopefully she pulls her finger out and gets it sorted.\"\n\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

    "text": "Britain is braced for the arrival of Storm Barbara, with winds of 90mph expected to batter some parts of the country.\n\nForecasters are warning that wintry showers, strong winds and lightning could lead to disruption to power supplies and travel across the north-west of the UK.\n\nThe Met Office has issued severe weather warnings for many parts of Britain, with Scotland expected to bear the brunt of the storm.\n\nAn amber \u201cbe prepared\u201d wind warning is in place for northern and western parts of Scotland for Friday afternoon, evening and overnight into Christmas Eve.\n\nTwo separate Yellow \u201cbe aware\u201d wind warnings are in place, one covering northern parts of the UK where gusts of 60 to 70mph are expected quite widely, and one for more southern areas, where a narrow and intense band of heavy rain and gusty winds could lead to some disruption.\n\nFlood alerts are also in place for the Highlands and Western Isles, as well as Skye and the Scottish Borders.\n\nBrent Walker, Met Office deputy chief meteorologist, said: \u201cStorm Barbara is crossing the Atlantic and will pass close to the north-west of the UK during Friday, bringing the potential for some disruption to power supplies and travel, and possibly structural damage.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish Government said it is being regularly updated on the expected impact on travel across the country.\n\nThe rest of Scotland, pockets of Northern Ireland, north Wales and the north of England are also due to feel the force of Storm Barbara on Friday.\n\nScotland\u2019s transport minister Humza Yousaf said: \u201cMinisters are getting regular updates on the status of Storm Barbara and the likely impacts, with gusts of 90mph expected across the far north of the country on Friday where the Met Office has an amber warning in place.\n\n\u201cThe safety of the travelling public is our main concern and services will run where possible, but planning in advance is essential and people should leave plenty of time for journeys and consider the conditions and when they travel.\u201d\n\nScotRail said that due to the severe weather conditions forecast, speed restrictions and a small number of service withdrawals will take place as a safety precaution on Friday.\n\nIt said that as some trains will be travelling at slower rates, their journey times will be extended and service levels on some lines in the south, west and north will have to be reduced as a result.\n\nSouth of the border, councils were said to be \u2018\u2019fully prepared\u2019\u2019 for the onset of harsh conditions over Christmas.\n\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), which represents hundreds of councils in England and Wales, said it was issuing renewed advice on how to deal with flash floods and has stockpiled more than one million tonnes of salt to grit roads.\n\nEnvironment spokesman Martin Tett said: \u2018\u2019Councils are fully prepared to protect residents and minimise disruption caused by Storm Barbara and other potential bad weather such as snow and flooding.\n\n\u201cCouncil staff will be out in force clearing roads of any debris and damage.\u2019\u2019",

    "title": "Proposed Body Camera Rules Are Ready For Lawmakers",
    "text": "The Department of Public Safety has finished its work on a model policy report for the use of police body cameras.\n\nThe Legislature asked the department to come up with the rules, which have been controversial, and difficult to finalize.\n\nThe Law Enforcement Advisory Board was supposed to have the body camera report done before Dec. 15.\n\nBut the board was held up trying to walk the fine line between protecting the public's privacy and making sure police have the tools they need to do their jobs.\n\nThe board finalized its report Thursday.\n\nBoard chairman Rick Gauthier says the technology around body cameras is still emerging, and there isn't a wide body of evidence out there to help build a long ranging policy.\n\n\"Some of the science and some of the techniques are continuing to evolve,\" Gauthier says. \"We felt that the field of law enforcement needed the latitude to change best practices as best practices evolve.\"\n\nThe report will go to the Legislature, and lawmakers will then come up with a statewide body camera policy, which police agencies will have to use as a baseline for the rules they write for their departments.\n\n\n\nOne of the most heated debates centered on whether officers could review footage before writing a report.\n\nGauthier says he looked at policies that are already in play around Vermont and that the bulk of the new proposed statewide standards align with what most police agencies are already doing.\n\nOne of the most heated debates centered on whether officers could review footage before writing a report.\n\n\"The Law Enforcement Advisory Board, Chief's Association, I believe the Sheriff's Association, probably the Vermont Police Association, were all strongly opposed, and I mean strongly opposed, to prohibiting officers from reviewing the contents of the recordings prior to making their reports,\" Gautheir says.\n\nThe final proposed rules say police should be able to review the footage.\n\nLia Ernst, staff attorney with ACLU Vermont, says whatever is or is not recorded can change how an officer perceives an event. Her organization opposes the rules as drafted.\n\n\"Just the mere act of looking at the footage affects your memory, or what you think you remember,\" Ernst says. \"And so there seems to be no good reason that I can think of to not get an officer's statement on the record first, before that memory is effectively erased and recorded over by viewing the footage.\"\n\nThe policy will be debated this year in the Legislature and Ernst says the fight will continue in the Statehouse.\n\nThe ACLU is a strong advocate for having body cameras on police officers, but Ernst says its vital that policies are written that protect the civil rights of anyone who happens to be in front of, or behind the cameras.\n\n\"We believe that the use of body cams when they're not accompanied by a sound and responsible policy can actually be more corrosive of public trust and more harmful than good.\" - Lia Ernst, staff attorney ACLU Vermont\n\n\"We have many, many concerns about the policy as currently drafted. If it remains in that form with the provisions as they are now, our advocacy would switch 180 degrees to advocating against the use of body cams at all,\" she says. \"We believe that the use of body cams when they're not accompanied by a sound and responsible policy can actually be more corrosive of public trust and more harmful than good.\"\n\nThe report also looked at the costs associated with purchasing and operating the body cams.\n\nThe proposed rules set up standards for the storage of recordings, when recordings can be released to the public, as well as when officers should have the cameras on or off.\n\n",

    "text": "The Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s new lease accounting standards announced earlier this year will require public companies to recognize assets and liabilities from operating leases on their balance sheets for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.\n\nThe changes \u2014 a response to a growing need to provide more transparency to off-balance sheet leasing obligations, estimated at some $1.2 trillion dollars \u2014 will impact not just accounting policies but lease vs. buy decisions within IT organizations whose companies will have to comply with the new standard.\n\n[ Back in 2002: Budget Strategies: A Lesson on Leasing ]\n\nBefore the new rule, only capital leases were required to be reported on balance sheets. Looking ahead, all leases must be recorded as liabilities. As a result, says Steven Kirz, managing director with business transformation and outsourcing advisory firm Pace Harmon, \u201ccompanies that were attracted to leasing in order to keep significant assets off the balance sheet may be less interested in leasing in the future. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest shakeup in the IT equipment leasing industry which has also been reeling from reductions in the cost of IT equipment and increased adoption of cloud computing. \u201cThe profits of the companies that lease IT equipment are under pressure,\u201d Kirz says. \u201cAt the same time, cloud adoption is shifting lessor relationships from the end-client to the cloud provider, and many cloud providers are building their own data centers with commodity equipment, thus shrinking the lessors\u2019 market size.\u201d\n\nThe upside to the new lease accounting standards\n\nIn the face of these trends, a number of large independent leasing companies have recently sold themselves to large banks resulting in market consolidation. Crestmark Bank bought equipment-leasing company TIP Capital in late 2014. Huntington Bank acquired Macquarie Equipment Finance last April. And Wells Fargo purchased GE Capital Vendor Finance in March.\n\nWhile the new leasing accounting standards may eliminate the upside of IT equipment leasing for some organizations, the shifting conditions in the leasing industry could offer some opportunities for those that chose to lease in the future. Lessors are likely to be more amenable to meet client demands in contract flexibility, says Kirz. What\u2019s more, leasing companies are also developing new value-added services to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market, according to Kirz. Some are offering free software to track inventory, assistance in swapping out assets at the end of leases, and state-of-the-art data cleansing and disposal, as examples. \u201cWhat has not changed is that over the long-term, leasing reduces IT equipment cost by approximately 10 percent, while keeping IT hardware life at 36 months or less,\u201d Kirz says.\n\nThe downside to the new lease accounting standards\n\nThe pitfalls associated with IT leasing also remain the same. \u201cThe most obvious problem is that in order for leasing to make financial sense, you have to be able to track the assets throughout their life to be able to return them,\u201d says Kirz. \u201cBeyond this issue, what many companies do not understand is that there is a broad spectrum of lessors and associated leasing contract terms; this is not a market in which there is a standard contact.\u201d\n\nAt one end of the spectrum are lessors that produce profits through the re-sale of the returned equipment; at the other are those that make their margins through onerous contract terms that reduce the financial or technology currency benefits that leasing can provide.\u201d\n\nSmart IT leaders will develop a rigorous business assessment of the benefits of buying vs. leasing in the current environment before making a decision as a start. \u201cTo avoid the risks and pitfalls associated with leasing, customers must be prepared to invest in the internal resources required to track assets,\u201d advises Kirz. \u201cIn addition, we recommend customers use RFIs and RFPs with a focus on flexible contract terms, elimination of onerous terms, and the inclusion of value-added services in order to differentiate one group of lessors from the other.\u201d\n\nIT leasing red flags\n\nIT leaders should steer clear of these contract terms when leasing technology equipment.\n\nPro-rated charges applying to all equipment from installation of last equipment to start of lease term. Interim rent charged against all equipment based on final installation. Excess penalties and charges for early termination of lease. Requirement for equipment to be insured and threat of automatic insurance provision triggered. Penalty provision for lease termination due to casualty or loss. Charges for all document and filing fees. Shipping charges to multiple destinations. Like-kind returns not specified or excluded. Any terms specifying a residual value guarantee or \u201cremarketing fee.\u201d\n\nSource: Pace Harmon",

    "title": "Edward Lucas: Estonia and the Euro",
    "text": "(from the Economist print edition)\n\nThe Baltic states\n\n\n\nEuro not bust\n\nMay 13th 2010\n\nFrom The Economist print edition\n\n\n\n\n\nEstonia gets a green light to join the euro. Other Baltic states will benefit too\n\n\n\nSURPRISES are Estonia\u2019s stock in trade. Its return to the world map in 1991 after a 51-year absence startled outsiders. So did what came next: a fast-growing economy, based on flat taxes, free trade and a currency board. In 2004 it confounded pessimists\u2019 expectations by joining the European Union and NATO. Now it is set to pull off another coup, gaining green lights from the European Commission and the European Central Bank in its bid to adopt the euro on January 1st 2011.\n\n\n\nMany thought that highly unlikely. Only two years ago a property bubble in the country popped, rocking the banking system and sending GDP plunging by 14.1% in 2009. Doom-mongers said devaluation was inevitable. But they were wrong. Flexible wages and prices have helped the economy stabilise: unit labour costs fell by 7.5% in the final quarter of 2009. Exports were up by a sixth in the first quarter of 2010 and the central bank forecasts growth this year of 1% (although that depends on the pace of recovery in Sweden and other export markets).\n\n\n\nThanks to a fiscal tightening of a stonking 7.5% of GDP, Estonia easily meets the euro zone\u2019s public-finance rules. Its gross debt in 2009 was only 7.2% of GDP (compared with 115% in Italy), and the government deficit is 1.7% (Greece\u2019s is 13.6%). The concern is sustainability: will future governments be so thrifty? Inflation is low: in the past 12 months the average figure was negative, at -0.7% well below the euro zone\u2019s 1% target. But the ECB report calls for \u201ccontinued vigilance\u201d, as well as efforts to raise productivity and competitiveness.\n\n\n\nThe real problem for Estonia is political, not economic. Some euro-zone members (France is often mentioned) think that allowing an obscure and volatile ex-communist economy to join a currency union that already has too many dodgy members should not be a priority. If Estonia is really so solid, why not wait a year to be sure?\n\n\n\nYet that would send a perverse message. Estonia is almost the only country in the whole EU that actually meets the common currency\u2019s rules. All those that use the euro have gaily breached the deficit and debt limits. The grit shown by Estonian politicians and the public in shrinking spending, raising taxes and cutting wages has been exemplary. Punishing Estonia, which obeyed the rules, while bailing out Greece, which has breached them flagrantly, would do little for the euro\u2019s credibility with governments and investors alike.\n\n\n\nEstonia has two more hurdles to jump before it can scotch the scoffers: an EU committee meeting at the end of May, followed by a finance ministers\u2019 summit in early June. Few think that France and other doubters will actually block Estonia\u2019s bid; persuasion and horse-trading will probably bring agreement. Then the decision will be irrevocable. That will give heart to Latvia and Lithuania, which hope to join the euro later in the decade. Like Estonia, their currencies are pegged to the euro, so they bear the pain of a rigid monetary regime, but also miss out on the lower borrowing costs and higher investment that membership of the currency can bring.\n\n\n\nThe next task is to stoke growth and cut unemployment (now over 15%). After that, the aim should be to reach Nordic-quality public services and an economy based on brainpower by 2018, when Estonia celebrates its 100th birthday and also holds the presidency of the EU.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Natatorium Design from a Racer\u2019s Point of View",
    "text": "Courtesy of Counsilman-Hunsaker, a SwimSwam partner.\n\nFor many swimmers, the months leading up to a championship competition are stressful. Tapering, travel, make-up assignments, proper nutrition, and getting much needed extra recovery between practices are just a few of the things that might burden a swimmer prior to a major championship event. It is important that a lackluster aquatic facility does not add to the stress or inhibit them from performing at their highest level.\n\nJust as swimmers prepare themselves physically for competition, they prepare themselves mentally as well. Much of this preparation takes place in the weeks leading up to a championship. However, there can be circumstances that are impossible to anticipate, such as the facility environment, that can leave an athlete psychologically vulnerable before the start of a race. It is the job of facility designers to be considerate of athletes when designing a top rate natatorium. Fast swims signify a fast pool and in order for fast swims to occur, most swimmers want the \u201crock-star\u201d experience.\n\nMany teams travel together to and from championship meets using a private bus service, fleet of vans, or a car with chauffer (coach/loving parent). Swimmer drop off might be at the back entrance of the natatorium where the meet is being held. If they\u2019re lucky, event staff might greet them with a high five and hold the door as swimmers are ushered off of the bus and into the facility. Chances are, they will have to walk through a long, barely lit, hallway to get to the locker rooms.\n\nThe locker room is an inevitable part of the swimmers natural progression to the blocks. Depending on the age groups participating, locker rooms can be difficult to make fool-proof. Given the opportunity, a group of 12 year-olds will make a slip and slide in the showers. Following warm up, swimmers journey to the locker room with a group of friends and change into their technical suits. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour deepening on how small the suit is. The atmosphere is charged. A great locker room should make athletes feel comfortable and efficiently move them in and out during this pre-meet surge. There is nothing worse than standing in line for one of three stalls with a 400 IM fast approaching.\n\nThe swimmers will emerge through a set of doors to the pool deck with music blaring and, ideally, hundreds of spectators waiting to watch some speed. As final preparations are made, swimmers will begin to shift into a racing mentality. Depending on the type of swim meet, some swimmers might wait have to wait hours to compete. Recognizing the proper amount of deck space required to keep entire teams of swimmers unencumbered during this waiting period is critical to the design process. Space is always a limiting factor, but the more seating and open areas provided that can help relieve any pre-tension, the better.\n\nThe scenario above only describes a swimmers entrance to a facility, however there is so much more that can affect a swimmers ability to race. Many swimmers follow pre-race routines that they have been doing for years. Some swimmers may become visibly energetic and vocal prior to stepping up on the blocks, while others take a more solitary and focused approach. Privacy may be an empty room, a corner under the stands, or simply a towel over the head. Regardless of how a swimmer prepares themselves individually, those good enough to advance to a finals heat will face another stage of preparation.\n\nContrary to the idea that athlete seating should relieve tension, the next step of the race progression should be designed around channeling energy. For high end competitions, a ready room must be provided. The location, design, and theme of this room can be a factor in motivating the swimmers. However, the most important factor is the time spent waiting in the room before the athletes are ceremoniously led out to their stations on deck. Facility designers might consider programming ideas for this room with meet officials or team representatives to ensure that not too much or too little time is spent waiting here. Everyone remembers the \u201cface\u201d made in the Rio 2016 ready room. A ready room creates an environment where a swimmer can ignite a passion within themselves moments before the start of a race. These internal factors affect the athlete prior to the race.\n\nFinally, there are environmental factors created by the scale of the facility. Spectators become a part of the experience. Teammates and the pre-race and post-race ceremonies all demonstrate this. Again, think \u201crock-star\u201d. The total pageantry of competitions, especially those at the highest levels, will have an impact on the athletes.\n\nIf all of the environmental cues and conditions come together, they help to produce record breaking times or personal best times for those that do not win. It can be a challenge to consider all of the users that will be fortunate enough to use an aquatic facility, but with careful planning and consideration, creating a great space is possible.\n\nThere are more factors that come into play when creating an optimal competition venue, however, those discussed here will almost always have a role. Additionally, these factors play a huge role in determining how swimmers and coaches will judge a natatorium and whether or not it is a \u201cfast pool\u201d.\n\nThe history of Counsilman-Hunsaker is valuable in the context and the confidence it provides. Over the past 45 years, we\u2019ve led the industry by completing more than 1,000 national and international aquatic projects of every size and complexity. In fact, many of the innovations that are now standard in the industry were conceived by our team.\n\nCounsilman-Hunsaker believes that people of all ages are changed for the better through aquatic experiences and that our services reach beyond just solving design, or engineering or facility operational challenges. Our mission is to create aquatic experiences that transform people and communities, which supports our mantra of \u201cAquatics for Life\u201d. And when we say \u201cAquatics for Life\u201d we\u2019re talking about the lives of humans we serve through every decision from conception, to the detail of daily operations. By focusing and serving the human experience, our full circle approach to everything we do allows us to be your guide every step of the way from facility audits, to program and design, thru facility creation and day to day operations.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ve developed an international reputation for innovation and integrity, as people who are passionate about what they do and who do it exceptionally well. Today, our firm consists of an integrated team of designers, engineers and operational specialists with incomparable aquatic industry experience.\n\nWE DO MORE THAN COMPETITIVE POOLS: SEE OUR PAST PROJECTS HERE\n\nCourtesy of Counsilman/Hunsaker & Associates, a SwimSwam ad partner.",

    "title": "The tech we didn\u2019t talk about in 2016, but should have",
    "text": "Looking back at this year in technology there were a number of things we should have, but didn\u2019t, talk about. In some cases, we were distracted by other things, in other cases no one wanted to say something negative about a strategy that promised a lot of success, and, finally, in some cases it probably just didn\u2019t occur to us that we were missing the big picture.\n\nLet me go through each.\n\nU.S. cybersecurity is a bad joke\n\nWe focused like a laser on Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, but what about the security that allowed it to exist in the first place? Seriously how the heck do you miss a rogue email server for a whopping four years? Particularly one that is sending and receiving things to NSA, CIA and FBI email servers. At the very least it should have been flagged as an unknown and potentially hostile email server and vetted. Yet it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAfter being made aware that Russia was hacking the election process the President told Putin to \u201ccut it out.\u201d Since when is it a proper response to an active cyberthreat to have the CEO call the attacker and ask them to stop it. What is particularly annoying is that the U.S. has been meddling in foreign elections for years and doesn\u2019t apparently have a good defense when one of these now pissed off governments returns the favor. This is seriously stupid.\n\nVirtual reality\n\nIf the market rejected 3D largely because it didn\u2019t like the idea of $100 glasses, why do folks think virtual reality (VR) will be successful with $800 headsets that make you blind to all around you? The damn things aren\u2019t just expensive, they are dangerous -- you can trip on the cord or fall over furniture. And if you thought glasses made you look stupid just how do you think you look in a that huge headset? The hot tech gift this Christmas wasn\u2019t a VR headset it was the Amazon Echo.\n\nEcho\n\nSpeaking of the Amazon Echo how the hell did Apple miss this product opportunity? It is basically a big iPod with a Siri-like digital assistant built in. Apple should have been able to do this product in its sleep, yet it is instead focused on autonomous cars, because Apple knows a ton about how to make a car. How the heck does Apple, who took the smartphone market from Palm and RIM, miss Amazon doing the same thing to it in music?\n\nPresidential analytics\n\nPresident Obama used analytics effectively against both McCain and Romney in the elections. This allowed him to better deploy resources and more effectively get the vote out resulting in two wins. Clinton worked for Obama for four years after he outperformed her as well in the democratic primary. Obama supported Clinton\u2019s candidacy. So why didn\u2019t Clinton use Obama\u2019s analytics team to assure her election outcome? It was like she started from scratch.\n\nOh, and given that pretty much the entire tech industry supported her, why didn\u2019t they actually help her get it right. Donald Trump had one guy, Peter Thiel, and outperformed Clinton. How is that even possible?\n\nFake news\n\nThere is a ton of focus on Russia being the source of fake news even though we know Google\u2019s ad engine pays for it. In fact Methbot is generating a whopping $3 million a day for these fake sites and stories and that is likely an understatement. So, rather than pounding on Russia, and telling them to \u201ccut it out,\u201d wouldn\u2019t a better fix be to call up Eric Schmidt, who is the chairman of Google and a personal friend of the President and ask him to stop paying these guys? If the incentives go away might that not reduce the amount of fake news?\n\nJust the tip of the iceberg\n\nThese are just a few of the things I think we should have been talking about and didn\u2019t over this last year. I\u2019m a tad worried about the U.S. government which seems increasingly clueless about cybersecurity even though, given the nation\u2019s tech dominance, we should be best at it. In the end, though, I\u2019ll be glad to say goodbye to 2016 and I\u2019m looking hopefully ahead to a better 2017. Here is hoping you have a wonderful holiday season and a great new year!",

    "text": "SPIEGEL: Mr. Tygart, few people know the darker side of sports better than you do. Are you able to derive any pleasure from watching the Olympic Games?\n\nTygart: Of course, I watched the Rio Games on TV, with my children. It was fantastic. The Olympics unite the world and inspire us to be a better version of ourselves. The competitions motivate the spectators, and the athletes' message is: You should have more confidence in your ability to achieve things, you should dream more.\n\nSPIEGEL: Really? You are enthusiastic even though you know how rotten competitive sports are?\n\nTygart: Being skeptical is part of my job, to question every amazing achievement. That's always there. But I am also capable of turning down the cynicism. The basic idea of sports, the fairness, the competition, remains a beautiful thing.\n\nSPIEGEL: Were there moments that particularly impressed you?\n\nTygart: Those were the moments when the athletes used their time in the limelight to take a stand against doping. The Rio Games were the first in which athletes from all over the world stood up for clean sport. It's not enough to just test athletes. The athletes themselves need to fight for their right to compete against clean athletes.\n\nSPIEGEL: Has the way athletes view the fight against doping changed?\n\nTygart: A great deal, in fact. Eight years ago, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) introduced its reporting system. Since then, top athletes have constantly had to provide details of their current whereabouts. To begin with, they complained about that, they felt it was an unreasonable demand.\n\nSPIEGEL: And today?\n\nTygart: Before the Rio Games, I received a letter from US swimmers. They wrote: \"Travis, we consent to having to tell you 365 days a year where we are. You wake us up at night to carry out doping test, or you interrupt our training. We have to accept that invasion of our privacy, but at the same time we are being deprived of our chances at international competitions, because in many countries these standards do not count for anything.\" In the old days, athletes got worked up about the strict rules -- today they get worked up about these rules being ignored elsewhere.\n\nAbout Travis Tygart Michael Dannenmann / DER SPIEGEL Travis Tygart, 45, is known around the world for his efforts to fight doping in sports. The lawyer, who has led the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) since 2007, rose to prominence after launching high-profile proceedings against US professional cycler Lance Armstrong. Following the procedures, Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France victories.\n\nSPIEGEL: This year, the sports world was severely shaken by the doping scandal in Russia exposed by a WADA investigation. Top athletes from many different sports were given banned substances, and their positive tests were manipulated. A huge deception, in which the Moscow Ministry of Sports, the national anti-doping agency and the intelligence service FSB are all tied up.\n\nTygart: There really was a lot going on.\n\nSPIEGEL: Was this a good year or a bad year for the fight against doping?\n\nTygart: Seen from the outside, it may well have been a bad year; there were lots of headlines that alarmed people. For someone like me, though, when cheats are exposed, this moves us forward.\n\nSPIEGEL: Would you have believed it possible for such a sophisticated doping system as the one in Russia to exist for many years?\n\nTygart: At that level and over that period of time? No, I could not have imagined that. They managed to break into sealed urine samples without anyone noticing, to exchange tainted samples against clean ones or to make them disappear altogether. Incredible.\n\nSPIEGEL: Previously, East Germany (GDR) had been considered to be the country in which the largest and most effective doping system was established.\n\nTygart: A few years ago I met up with victims of GDR doping. That opened my eyes. But let me tell you: Russia has surpassed the system that was used back then.\n\nSPIEGEL: Why?\n\nTygart: The world has changed since the Cold War. The GDR and the Soviet Union had forced their athletes into doping. That was a crime that was never to happen again. In 2005, more than 200 countries signed a UNESCO treaty, the Convention against Doping in Sport. In it, they all undertook to protect athletes and not to abuse them. Everyone agreed to this, including the US, Germany and Russia too. And now that country is stepping out of line, and stabbing everyone else in the back? And even laughing at us? That is perverse.\n\nSPIEGEL: Nevertheless, the IOC allowed almost 300 Russian athletes to compete at the Olympic Games in Rio. Do you understand this?\n\nTygart: No. I think it was about politics and power. Russia is a big, powerful country. If it had been about a different country, the IOC certainly would have suspended it from the Olympics. Even if it had been us Americans.\n\nSPIEGEL: Do you really believe that?\n\nTygart: If a scam like that had happened in the USA, it would definitely have been the right thing to exclude us.\n\nSPIEGEL: Thomas Bach, the President of the IOC, is fond of talking about a zero-tolerance policy towards people who dope. Do you believe him?\n\nTygart: No. Zero tolerance has turned into tolerance for state-sponsored doping; the threat of tough consequences has turned into no consequences at all.\n\nSPIEGEL: What impact does the IOC's decision have?\n\nTygart: It was a slap in the face for many people. They were forced to recognize that the IOC leadership is interested in something else apart from protecting its Olympic values. The IOC has forfeited people's trust.\n\nSPIEGEL: Two weeks ago, WADA published another investigation report on Russia. More than 1,000 athletes from 30 different sports profited from the doping system. Is it time that Russia was excluded from international competitions in all sports?\n\nTygart: Yes, until the country regains compliance with the anti-doping code.\n\nSPIEGEL: Will we ever know the full extent of the Russian doping system?\n\nTygart: It's not likely. The truth is, Russia has not even come close to admitting they have a problem -- or even showing the slightest degree of contrition. Athletes and politicians continue to obstruct the investigation.\n\nSPIEGEL: Can Russia's sports ever be clean again?\n\nTygart: Yes, but it will take time. Education and prevention are not enough when there is a culture of fraud. The system worked from the top down, the athletes were subjugated to it. Orders were given: Either you take this and this substance, or you'll be kicked off the team. You have to deprive the government of its influence on the anti-doping agency, on the coaches and athletes, and on the laboratories.\n\nSPIEGEL: And if that doesn't happen?\n\nTygart: Then there could soon be a revolution among the athletes.\n\nSPIEGEL: How do you mean that?\n\nTygart: I recently spoke to an American racing cyclist. He told me he has given up thinking about the fact that others might be doped. He tries to ignore it. Otherwise he would go crazy and be unable to go on training. But the nasty feeling keeps catching up with him, at the latest when it comes to taking part in races. Something is swelling up among our athletes. Many of them are frustrated, everywhere in the world, and they are looking for a way out. Either they start doping themselves, or they give up the sport. Or else they stand up and demand that those who have the power to should change the system.\n\nSPIEGEL: What makes athletes dope in the first place?\n\nTygart: They believe that everyone else is doing it too. That is the most frequent justification. But I have never heard a doping offender say he felt good about doing it. Not a single one. Some athletes justify their actions by saying it enabled them to afford a bigger house or a better car. But they are never really happy. They know that they are not real winners.\n\nSPIEGEL: Just before the Olympics in Rio, American swimmers and athletes applied for so-called Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs), to take various drugs that are on the list of banned substances. Does a culture of fraud exist in US sport too?\n\nTygart: This is a mechanism by which athletes around the world can apply for the use of a prohibited substance when medically necessary. It takes a lot more than just a prescription from your local doctor. Here in the United States, we have an extremely thorough process by which those applications are reviewed. Often times we're talking about things like acne medication and birth control. This is not even closely related to the Russian institutionalized doping program. But of course, unfortunately, in every country there will always be some with a \"win at all cost\" mentality and who try to subvert the rules -- it would be na\u00efve to think otherwise.\n\nSPIEGEL: Whether Russia or the cases of the US athletes Lance Armstrong and Marion Jones -- the big doping scandals of the past years were triggered by insiders who were no longer willing to remain silent. Are whistleblowers more important today than doping tests?\n\nTygart: Both are important. Tests have a deterrent effect. Without them it would be too tempting for athletes and those around them to cheat. In order to expose a system though, you need whistleblowers.\n\nSPIEGEL: You were able to catch Lance Armstrong because his former teammates Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis came clean. You came to the aid of the runner Yuliya Stepanova and her husband Vitaly, who supplied evidence of doping in Russia. How do you approach a whistle-blower?\n\nTygart: He delivers information up front, which we then follow up. In return, we offer our help. My first question is always: How can we support you? Do you need legal assistance, because you yourself face prosecution? Should we provide someone to deal with media enquiries? But I also tell the whistleblower that we may also punish him, if he himself has resorted to doping.\n\nSPIEGEL: Whistleblowers often take a big risk and put their livelihood on the line. The Stepanovs even left Russia and today live in the U.S.\n\nTygart: No one imagined that it would get to the point where a young couple with a baby would be forced to flee because they feared for their lives. That was a new dimension. They believe that they are in danger in their home country; we are trying to offer them protection.\n\nSPIEGEL: The IOC did not allow Yuliya Stepanova to compete in Rio. It claimed that she did not fulfil the ethical standards of an Olympic athlete, because she herself had doped. Was that the right decision or the wrong one?\n\nTygart: If she had taken part, it would have been a signal to every athlete in the world: Stand up and say what you know! It was a missed opportunity.\n\nSPIEGEL: Is there anything you have learned from the scandals surrounding Russia?\n\nTygart: It was proof that the fight against doping is not effective if organized sport has an influence on it. Craig Reedie, the head of WADA, for example, is a member of the IOC. That is a conflict of interest. It is like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox. WADA must become independent of sports at long last and be able to punish countries like Russia as a global guardian.\n\nSPIEGEL: Four years ago, you exposed Lance Armstrong as a doper: one of the most popular sports stars in the world, who had a great deal of influence and who could afford the best lawyers in the world. What sort of person do you need to be in order to challenge such a powerful opponent?\n\nTygart: That was the biggest case we ever had. My team and I faced the question: Do we want to sit back and watch an indisputable case of doping be covered up? We decided: No, we are going to do our job, even if it turns out to be difficult.\n\nSPIEGEL: It became pretty difficult. Armstrong berated you and politicians accused you of wasting taxpayers' money on the hunt.\n\nTygart: At the time, we received 7,000 hate mails. People would write: You are demolishing our hero, you are not true Americans. Bearing up to that kind of thing is part of our job. When you notice that politicians and the media are after you, it makes you all the more determined to find out the truth.\n\nSPIEGEL: Did you still feel that way when you received death threats?\n\nTygart: No one likes that sort of thing.\n\nSPIEGEL: You could even hate it.\n\nTygart: Security guards accompanied my children to school and kept watch when they were playing soccer in our yard. You don't want to put your family into that kind of situation. But if you allowed that to influence you, clean athletes wouldn't have a chance. It is a tough and often also thankless task.\n\nSPIEGEL: Have you seen Armstrong again since 2012?\n\nTygart: Yes, we met up a couple of times and talked about the things he is accused of. I never felt hostile towards him, I never took the matter personally.\n\nSPIEGEL: How is he living today?\n\nTygart: He is preparing for his court case.\n\nSPIEGEL: It involves 100 million dollars which the government wants back from him.\n\nTygart: That is demanding his full attention; only afterwards will he be able to think about what he wants to do with the rest of his life. I hope that one day he will reach a point where he can leave everything behind him and be a productive member of society again.\n\nSPIEGEL: Mr. Tygart, we thank you for this interview.",

    "title": "The 49ers Should Select Miami Quarterback Brad Kaaya in 2017 NFL Draft",
    "text": "The San Francisco 49ers have no shortage of needs in the upcoming 2017 NFL Draft. With one of them being at quarterback, the Niners could do worse than select Miami QB Brad Kaaya with an early pick.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers would be wise to target Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya with their second pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.\n\nCurrently, the Niners are in line to own the No. 2 overall pick in the upcoming draft. And while quarterback is a pressing need, few draft experts are listing the QB position as a deep one.\n\nCBS Sports\u2019 Rob Rang even went on to say \u201cthe talent is not as impressive\u201d at quarterback. Rang\u2019s latest big board has the first quarterback, North Carolina\u2019s Mitch Trubisky, at No. 13.\n\nAt No. 2 overall, San Francisco would be reaching for a quarterback.\n\nBut with the team\u2019s first pick in Round 2, well, that\u2019s another story.\n\nOne would be a fool to think current starting quarterback Colin Kaepernick is the long-term answer. Let\u2019s save the details and simply admit he\u2019s not. Whether or not he opts out this offseason, or the 49ers simply cut him, remains to be seen. But even those scenarios not happening doesn\u2019t mean the Niners can avoid this need altogether.\n\nSan Francisco should save its first pick for the best player available, which could wind up being Texas A&M edge rusher Myles Garrett. Or the team could trade down, acquiring more picks along the way.\n\nJust save that second pick for Kaaya. Here\u2019s why.\n\nBreaking Down the Stats\n\nKaaya\u2019s three collegiate seasons at Miami have almost been mirror images of each other. Just take a look at his numbers, courtesy of Sports Reference:\n\n2015 and 2016 are almost identical, literally. But Kaaya improved his passing touchdown totals by seven, while only seeing two more interceptions on the board compared to the year prior.\n\nIf there\u2019s a knock against Kaaya, it\u2019s his arm strength. Various scouts around the league have called this into question, Rang being one of them.\n\nAnd Pro Football Focus\u2018 adjusted-completion percentage stats show the difference:\n\n6-10 Yards: 73.9 percent\n\n11-20 Yards: 51.5 percent\n\n21-30 Yards: 40 percent\n\n31-40 Yards: 46.7 percent\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting here though is Kaaya\u2019s completion percentage actually jumps above national average (36.5) on throws between 31 and 40 yards. So maybe that\u2019s something to consider.\n\nBreaking Down the Intangibles\n\nAt 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds, Kaaya looks the part of an NFL quarterback and has room to put a bit more muscle on his body.\n\nPerhaps this alleviates some of the concerns about his arm strength.\n\nNonetheless, one of his best attributes is being able to work in a pro-style system, something he\u2019s done as a three-year starter at Miami:\n\nMiami's Brad Kaaya is a three-year starter from a pro-style system with plenty of upside. Oh, he's also younger than both Kizer and Trubisky \u2014 Brent Sobleski (@brentsobleski) December 21, 2016\n\nAccording to Rang, Kaaya has a keen awareness within the pocket and is able to read defenses in order to determine mismatches.\n\nAnd we can see some of those traits, as well as some touch passes, in this DraftBreakdown.com video below:\n\nThere are times where he locks onto his receiver, but it\u2019s not quite as frequent as, let\u2019s say, Kaepernick and his one-read looks.\n\nSo would Kaaya be a good fit for San Francisco?\n\nBleacher Report\u2019s Matt Miller thinks so and even has Kaaya mocked to the 49ers in Round 2.\n\nRight where we thought he should go.\n\nThat\u2019s the right move for San Francisco \u2014 use the team\u2019s first pick on the best player available or trade down, then take Kaaya early in the second round.\n\nDoing so would be a smart move on the Niners\u2019 part. And they\u2019d have a quarterback to groom and develop into a potential franchise signal-caller for years to come.\n\nKaaya has until January 16 to decide whether or not he wants to enter the 2017 NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on",

    "text": "Use your \u2190 \u2192 (arrow) keys to browse more stories\n\nThanks to the 2016 Hawaii Bowl between the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors and Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders, college football fans will see plenty of scoring on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe tropical setting pits the Rainbow Warriors (6-7) in a familiar environment and provides a chance to prove they deserved to be back in a bowl game with a losing record.\n\nFor the Blue Raiders (8-4), it is all about getting healthy and making a big statement to end the season while riding a high-flying offense capable of some eye-popping numbers.\n\nBelow is a look at everything to know about the holiday affair.\n\nHawaii Bowl 2016\n\nDate: Saturday, Dec. 24\n\nTime (ET): 8 p.m.\n\nLocation: Aloha Stadium, Halawa, Hawaii\n\nWatch: ESPN\n\nLive Stream: WatchESPN\n\nTickets: ScoreBig.com\n\nOver/Under: 70\n\nSpread: Middle Tennessee (-4.5)\n\nTeam Injury Reports\n\nHawaii NAME POS STATUS Devan Stubblefield WR Ques Sat Melvin Davis RB Out for season Daniel Lewis Jr. DB Ques Sat USA Today\n\nMiddle Tennessee NAME POS STATUS John Urzua QB Ques Sat Carlos Johnson OL Ques Sat Brent Stockstill QB Ques Sat Demetrius Frazier WR Out indefinitely Jocquez Bruce WR Prob Sat Shane Tucker WR Out indefinitely Terry Pettis WR Out for season USA Today\n\nInjury reports courtesy of USA Today.\n\nMaking the Most of a Bid\n\nA photo posted by Hawaii Athletics (@hawaiiathletics) on Dec 19, 2016 at 10:11pm PST\n\nMany will decry Hawaii's appearance in a bowl game. It took a 13th game during the regular season combined with not enough teams finishing with winning records to get the Rainbow Warriors bowling.\n\nFew fans should complain given the potency of the offense. Quarterback Dru Brown only threw 15 touchdowns, seven of which went to Marcus Kemp.\n\nThe real allure of the Rainbow Warriors is the deep, potent rushing attack:\n\nNAME CAR YDS AVG LONG TD Diocemy Saint Juste 140 836 6.0 59 3 Paul Harris 77 537 7.0 44 2 Steven Lakalaka 100 415 4.2 30 (TD) 12 Dru Brown 79 283 3.6 62 (TD) 3 ESPN.com.\n\nThe attack has quite the snowball effect when working, hence outputs of 41, 38, 34, 34 and 46 points in five of the team's six wins on the year. Offense hasn't been the problem for the Rainbow Warriors\u2014it's a defense allowing 37.5 points per game.\n\nShould the defense cause the Rainbow Warriors to fall behind, Brown has the arm talent to help his team fight back, seeing as he completed 62 percent of his passes on the season.\n\nIn front of a friendly crowd, though, Hawaii will look to ride its strength on the ground and show the globe it deserved to go bowling.\n\nBetter Late Than Never\n\nL.G. Patterson/Associated Press\n\nThanks to the long layoff between the regular season and bowl games, Middle Tennessee should have quarterback Brent Stockstill back under center.\n\nStockstill missed three games with an injury, but it sounds like the team will have him back just in time for the bowl.\n\n\"Brent has had a good week of practice,\" Blue Raiders head coach Rick Stockstill said, according to Stats LLC (via ESPN.com). \"He has had a couple of positive checkups and we are preparing like he will be under center for us come Saturday.\"\n\nOver just nine games, Stockstill completed 63.9 percent of his passes with 27 touchdowns to five interceptions\n\nThat isn't to suggest Middle Tennessee suffered too much without its starting quarterback\u2014after all, the team dropped 77 points in its regular-season finale against FAU, giving the offense eight outings at 38 or more points.\n\nI'Tavius Mathers is a huge part of this. He has 1,504 yards and 16 touchdowns on the ground while averaging 6.8 yards per carry. But he also has 589 yards and three touchdowns on 62 catches.\n\nMaybe the biggest hurdle for the Blue Raiders Sunday is simply getting everyone back on the same page in a hostile environment.\n\nPrediction\n\nMark Humphrey/Associated Press\n\nWhich team will win? Hawaii Middle Tennessee Submit Vote vote to see results Which team will win? Hawaii 0%\n\nMiddle Tennessee 0% Total votes: 0\n\nThose looking to make holiday picks here seem to have an easy time.\n\nThe Middle Tennessee offense, though on the road and working a starter back into the system, simply has to pull away to nullify the Hawaii rushing attack. The Rainbow Warriors could control the pace of the game, but few have done so against the Blue Raiders this year.\n\nWere the Rainbow Warriors' defense not so leaky, this prediction might swing the other direction. But a friendly crowd isn't enough here\u2014look for Middle Tennessee to pull ahead early and refuse to let off the gas.\n\nPrediction: Middle Tennessee 45, Hawaii 30\n\n\n\nStatistics courtesy of ESPN unless otherwise specified.

    "title": "How Deutsche's Wall Street bet turned toxic",
    "text": "Deutsche Bank's pursuit of success on has come at a high price, a $7 billion-plus penalty illustrating the extent of its decline since 2008 when its then chief executive claimed it was one of the \"strongest banks in the world\".\n\nExpanding from its roots in Germany dating back to 1870, Deutsche transformed itself into a major player on over the past two decades, often taking extravagant bets to do so.\n\nBut it is now set to cut back its activities in the world's biggest economy after a penalty for the sale of toxic mortgage securities that contributed to the biggest economic crash in a generation.\n\n\"The strategic options open to Deutsche Bank in the United States of America (US) are clearly restricted because the profitability of the business will be weakened,\" said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, a shareholder in Deutsche.\n\nGerman regulators also want Deutsche, the country's largest bank which employs around 1,00,000 people around the world, to rein itself in.\n\n\"Size in itself is no sign of success,\" said one senior official in Germany, where the mood among regulators has hardened towards the bank. \"They now want to curtail their ambitions.\"\n\nLast year, the bank's arm, where roughly one in ten of its staff are based, racked up a loss of $2.9 billion- almost half the total loss made by the group.\n\nThat was a swing from a profit of more than $1 billion in the previous year. Much of the damage was done by a writedown on the value of Bankers Trust, while tighter regulation has made it more expensive to trade.\n\nEXPANSION PHASE\n\nThe $7.2 billion penalty for the sale of toxic mortgage securities closes a sobering chapter in the bank's international drive, launched in 1989 by the then chief executive, Hilmar Kopper, when he bought lender Morgan Grenfell in London.\n\nKopper is remembered for his public description of a multi-million Deutsche mark sum as \"peanuts\"- opening a divide between an increasingly Anglo-Saxon bank and the prevailing frugal culture among ordinary Germans.\n\nA decade later, Deutsche bought Bankers Trust, paying $10 billion for the and an estimated severance of $100 million to its chief executive. Management even discussed a takeover of Lehman Brothers, which later collapsed at the lowest point in the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nThis strategy of buying to expand in shares and bonds was expanded to add outsized bets on toxic derivatives and the lender's total assets swelled to more than $2 trillion in 2007.\n\nOne former senior Deutsche executive, who asked not to be named and who was instrumental in building the bank's business, said he had preferred using leverage to sell more structured debt and derivatives to buying a rival.\n\n\"Buying a firm is like climbing Everest without oxygen. It is risky, and the achievement is substantial, but is it really worth it?\" the former executive said, asking not to be named. \"You may find that the view from the summit is quite cloudy.\"\n\nYet this alternative route proved perilous.\n\nWORLD'S STRONGEST\n\nAs the bank placed large trades at the end of 2011, its leverage ratio, which divides the value of assets by equity, reached around 21- measured by accounting standards.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the higher this leverage, the steeper the risks. JP Morgan, a much larger bank, had a lower ratio of around 17.\n\nThere was another important difference between Deutsche and its U.S. rivals. They had been able to improve their capital with a compulsory $700 billion \"Troubled Assets Relief Programme\" (Tarp). Rivals Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America all took the money.\n\nAt that time, in October 2008, Deutsche Bank's then Chief Executive Josef Ackermann described the bank as one of the \"strongest and best-capitalised banks in the world,\" privately saying he would have been \"ashamed\" if it needed state help.\n\nHowever, analysts and regulators have since bemoaned Deutsche's thin capital cushion.\n\nNEW MOOD\n\nEncouraged by its apparent success in the early years of the crisis, the bank's management focused on structured finance and securitisation, credit and equity derivatives, distressed debt and leveraged lending.\n\nBut the mood in the United States had changed towards banks that juiced profits with large punts.\n\nIn September 2016, Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo demanded a new capital buffer from investment banks, and, crucially for Deutsche, that it be held locally- in the United States.\n\n\"Financial regulation should be progressively more stringent for firms of greater importance,\" Tarullo said at the time.\n\nOther problems were also brewing. Deutsche had been singled out in a 2011 Senate committee report that said one of its traders had called re-parcelled mortgage debt \"crap\" or \"pigs\".\n\nThat trader, Greg Lippmann, who the committee said in its investigation had also described such securities as a \"Ponzi scheme\", took a $5 billion short position on behalf of the bank, betting that mortgage-related securities would fall in value.\n\nThat inspired 'The Big Short' film, where actor Ryan Gosling played a character inspired by Lippmann.\n\nLippmann has declined to answer questions from Reuters on the subject.\n\nThe market no longer has pride of place for the bank, which has begun to lay more emphasis again on its German roots.\n\nPeople with knowledge of the bank's strategy have recently said it is looking to cut its loan securitisation business, starting with repackaged mortgages.\n\nA final decision about this core business is set to come early next year, the people said, with a rolling back of the repackaging and resale of mortgages also expected as Chief Executive John Cryan seeks to move the business ahead.",

    "title": "Daily Rocket Science: Comeback Narrative",
    "text": "The Houston Rockets are playing out a dramatic comeback story this season, redeeming their shortcomings of last season one win at a time.\n\nThis time last year, Houston Rockets fans were beginning to lose hope in their team. Ty Lawson proved to be a bust and rumors circled that said James Harden wasn\u2019t a good team player. Things didn\u2019t get much better throughout the season, and the Rockets were eventually stomped by the Golden State Warriors in 5 games to put an end to their misery.\n\nNow, things are completely different. Nearly every unbiased source considers the Rockets an elite team, and Harden is back to being an MVP candidate. Winning 13 of their last 15 games, things are looking up for Red Nation. Today\u2019s Daily Rocket Science will cover the various subplots of this great comeback narrative that\u2019s following Houston this season.\n\nHouston Rockets news and notes from around the web\n\nJames Harden is this year\u2019s greatest redemption story, writes Duncan Smith of the newly launched 16 Wins a Ring. He\u2019s clearly one of the best offensive talents in the league, and isn\u2019t a blight on the other side of the ball either. It\u2019s time to give credit where credit is due.\n\nYes, that\u2019s right, James Harden is positively average on defense. Tell your friends, Harden is no turnstile. Not anymore at least. Now that he is longer required to take a beating on offense on drives to the paint every possession, Harden is able to maintain a more-than-acceptable level of defense for a top-five NBA offensive talent. He\u2019s a neutral defender at worst by almost every metric that matters, and he\u2019s capable of making game-changing plays\u2026\n\nWith the Beard\u2019s improved play, the Rockets\u2019 front office is surely glad that they locked him into another year in Houston with his contract extension this past summer. Now, according to the Houston Chronicle\u2019s Jonathan Feigen, he could sign yet another huge extension with the new labor deal in place. Feigen outlines exactly how that would work, and notes that both parties would probably be on board with the idea.\n\n\u201cThey love me, man. I love them,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI love being here. We\u2019re going to win a lot. I\u2019m excited to be here. That\u2019s one of the reasons I extended this summer. Obviously, this year\u2019s been great. I\u2019ve been happy, probably the happiest I\u2019ve been since I\u2019ve been in a Rockets uniform. Everybody else is happy.\u201d\n\nEric Gordon is another player who\u2019s enjoyed telling a comeback story. After a few disappointing years in New Orleans, he\u2019s playing some of the best basketball of his career as a sixth man. The Vertical\u2019s Michael Lee discusses the reasons why he fits so extremely well in Houston\u2019s high-powered offense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be able to be a playmaker and a scorer at the same time. James has his unit and I have my unit. I\u2019m just free will to do whatever I want to do on the court,\u201d Gordon, averaging 17.5 points and 2.8 assists, told The Vertical. \u201c[Harden] draws a lot of attention, and when teams sag off, I\u2019m there. He\u2019s able to always find the right guy and it\u2019s just all about me and other guys knocking down shots.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets, after losing a heartbreaker to the Spurs to break their 10-game winning streak, found their mojo the following night against the Suns. Tonight, they take on the Grizzlies, who sit just two spots back in the standings at 5th in the Western Conference.\n\nMemphis is known for their gritty defense, and will surely put the Rockets to the test tonight.

    "text": "Cupertino's cold warriors\n\nMay 6th 2010\n\nFrom Economist.com\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has Apple got against eastern Europe?\n\n\n\nWHAT have the following places got in common?\n\n\n\nAmerica, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Vietnam.\n\n\n\nClearly the size of the market is not the determinant. China and Russia don\u2019t appear, but Luxembourg does. It is not about prosperity: Iceland\u2014which, believe it or not, is still one of the richer countries in the world\u2014is out, whereas Vietnam is in. Political freedom or the rule of law are not the binding factors. The Philippines and Thailand are on the list, whereas impeccable democracies such as Slovenia are not.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the list comprises the target markets of some tiresome company from \u201cold Europe\u201d that has not noticed that the Berlin Wall has come down and that the division of Europe at Yalta into consumer-citizens in a rich, free west and captive east is long out of date.\n\n\n\nBut no, the list comes from a company that prides itself on being an icon of \u00fcber-cool internationalism, with a post-modern disdain for clunky convention and tiresome rules. It is from the Apple Store, where eager customers from all over the world end up in the hope of buying an iPad, or a humble $25 gift card.\n\n\n\nFirst-time visitors are assumed to be from America. If you come from one of the countries listed above, you can switch. But if not, you are out of luck. No matter if your country is in the European Union, NATO and the OECD. For Apple, the eastern half of Europe is still both terra incognita and non desiderata.\n\n\n\nStill, you can always buy your Apple hardware from an authorised reseller. The real irritation comes when you want to buy electrons, not atoms. Sign up for an iTunes account, and the opening windows offer a glimmer of hope. It offers not just two kinds of Portuguese, but Polish and Russian too, as well as the mysterious \u201cSpanish (International Sort)\u201d. It looks fine. So\u2014at first sight\u2014does the iTunes store, which offers a tempting array of countries.\n\n\n\nBut some are more equal than others. Visitors from Finland, for example, are presented with a full array of music. But register with an address in Estonia, just half an hour away by plane, and you get only a list, admittedly rich, of games, gimmicks and lectures. Films and music are out of bounds.This approach annoys a lot of people. One organisation in Poland has been berating Apple for its approach to the biggest and most advanced market in eastern Europe. It is now celebrating a partial victory (Apple has agreed to open up its distribution market). But even in Poland, the company\u2019s offering is nothing like what you get across the border in Germany. Other countries in the region have yet to see any improvement at all.One of those most irked by the company's approach is the iPhone-toting president of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, a loyal customer since 1982, when he bought an Apple IIe. Estonia, he notes, is one of the most wired countries on earth. Tallinn is the centre of NATO\u2019s cyber-warfare research, and Estonians invented another icon of internet cool: Skype. Skype\u2019s director of new products, Sten Tamkivi, has an iPhone, an iPad and a Mac at home. He describes the Apple rule as \u201ca weird relic of commercial east-west segregation inside what is otherwise known as the European Union\".Why doesn\u2019t Apple, a company so irritatingly up to date in its products and marketing, update its worldview when it comes to sales? Apple\u2019s global headquarters did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman in Britain promised to investigate. When we get an answer, we\u2019ll post it here.",

    "text": "The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has made several changes to the existing passport rules in order to \"streamline, liberalise and ease the process of issue of passport.\" The biggest of these is the issue of the proof of date of birth, but the MEA has also made changes to the procedure of filling of online forms in the passport application process.\n\nThe MEA said in a statement released on Friday: \"The Ministry of External Affairs expects that the changes in the Passport Rules would further ease the process for passport applicants in getting their Passport. At the same time, it would enable this ministry to continue to deliver passport related services to the citizens in a timely, transparent, more accessible, reliable manner and in a comfortable environment through streamlined processes and committed, trained and motivated workforce.\"\n\nRules for proof of DoB\n\nThe first of the changes is in the provision of proof of Date of Birth (DoB) of people born after January 26, 1989. Earlier, these people were mandatorily required to provide birth certificates as proof of DoB.\n\nAs per the new rules, they can submit any of eight different documents as such proof. Besides the birth certificate, these include transfer, school-leaving or matriculation certificates, Aadhaar or e-Aadhaar documents, PAN cards, driving licence and even the Election Photo Identity Card, or EPIC.\n\nEasier online application system\n\nFollowing the recommendations of a three-member committee that included MEA and Ministry of Women and Child Development officials, the MEA has also eased the process of applying for a passport online.\n\nFor starters, it has now allowed an applicant to mention the name of either their father or mother or legal guardian \u2014 as opposed to both parents earlier. The MEA said about the change: \"This would enable single parents to apply for passports for their children and to also issue passports where the name of either the father or the mother is not required to be printed at the request of the applicant.\"\n\nA number of other changes have also been made in the Passport Rules of 1980.

    "title": "Remembering Thomas Eakins, the man who introduced the camera to the American art studio",
    "text": "Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins was an American photographer, realist painter, sculptor, and fine arts educator. He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history. July 25, 2016 / Photography News / Born 173 years ago today,was an American photographer, realist painter, sculptor, and fine arts educator. He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history.\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Eakins and the Metropolitan Museum, page 45. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1994). During his study in Europe, he was exposed to the use of photography by the French realists, though the use of photography was still frowned upon as a shortcut by traditionalists. In the late 1870s he was introduced to the photographic motion studies of Eakins has been credited with having \"introduced the camera to the American art studio\" (Rosenheim, Jeff L., \"Thomas Eakins, Artist-Photographer, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art\",, page 45. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1994). During his study in Europe, he was exposed to the use of photography by the French realists, though the use of photography was still frowned upon as a shortcut by traditionalists. In the late 1870s he was introduced to the photographic motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge , particularly the equine studies, and became interested in using the camera to study sequential movement. He performed his own motion studies, usually involving the nude figure, and even developed his own technique for capturing movement on film. Where Muybridge 's system relied on a series of cameras triggered to produce a sequence of individual photographs, Eakins preferred to use a single camera to produce a series of exposures on one negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy in Human Motion. Photograph by Thomas Eakins.\n\nEakins' so-called \"Naked Series\", which began in 1883, were nude photos of students and professional models which were taken to show real human anatomy from several specific angles, and were often hung up and displayed for study at the school. Later, less regimented poses were taken indoors and out, of men, women, and children, including his wife. The most provocative, and the only ones combining males and females, were nude photos of Eakins and a female model.\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Eakins carrying a woman, 1885. Photograph: circle of Eakins.\n\nNo other American artist of his time matched Eakins' interest in photography, nor produced a comparable body of photographic works. In all, about eight hundred photographs are now attributed to Eakins and his circle, most of which are figure studies, both clothed and nude, and portraits. No other American artist of his time matched Eakins' interest in photography, nor produced a comparable body of photographic works.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Eakins obtained a camera in 1880, several paintings are known to have been derived at least in part from his photographs. Some figures appear to be detailed transcriptions and tracings from the photographs by some device like a magic lantern, which Eakins took pains to cover up with oil paint.\n\nThese controversies may have been caused by a combination of factors such as the bohemianism of Eakins and his circle (in which students, for example, sometimes modeled in the nude for each other), the intensity and authority of his teaching style, and Eakins's inclination toward unorthodox or provocative behavior. Since the 1990s, Eakins has emerged as a major figure in sexuality studies in art history, for both the homoeroticism of his male nudes and for the complexity of his attitudes toward women. Controversy shaped much of his career as a teacher and as an artist. He insisted on teaching men and women \"the same\", used nude male models in female classes and vice versa, and was accused of abusing female students. Recent scholarship suggests that these scandals were grounded in more than the \"puritanical prudery\" of his contemporaries\u2014 as had once been assumed\u2014 and that Eakins's progressive academic principles may have protected unconscious and dubious agendas. These controversies may have been caused by a combination of factors such as the bohemianism of Eakins and his circle (in which students, for example, sometimes modeled in the nude for each other), the intensity and authority of his teaching style, and Eakins's inclination toward unorthodox or provocative behavior.\n\nThomas Eakins died on June 25, 1916.",

    "title": "Notre Dame Football: My Irish Fan Holiday Wishlist",
    "text": "It\u2019s been such a long and disappointing year for Notre Dame football. From losing the Fiesta Bowl to becoming our head coach\u2019s worst enemy, the Fighting Irish fans have been through a lot.\n\nNot every part was bad. Kinda. In the few games Notre Dame won, fans didn\u2019t mind watching. Even if it\u2019s only four times a year, everyone loves to win.\n\nSeeing Will Fuller, Jaylon Smith, C.J. Prosise, Ronnie Stanley, and others continue their dream on draft night is something every Irish fan hold dear to their heart. These men will always be Notre Dame stars first.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of pain, though. With the expectations 2016 threw at us, everyone was excited to watch the Fighting Irish compete with the best teams in the country. College Football Playoff is the only thing anyone had on their mind before the season started. But after a 1-3 start, everyone knew the season was headed for disaster.\n\nFrom there it just got worse. Brian Kelly became the most hated man in South Bend, and still should have a hard time looking fans in the eyes. It seemed 99% of Irish fans wanted him gone the second Notre Dame\u2019s season ended. On top of it all, the Irish got blown out by USC. USC!\n\nThat\u2019s all behind us now. The season is over, Brian Kelly isn\u2019t being fired, and Notre Dame has now lost two quarterbacks. But hey, there\u2019s always next year, right? Right?\n\nWant your voice heard? Join the Slap the Sign team!\n\nSo, in the spirit of Christmas, here\u2019s a little list. Just something I\u2019m asking for this holiday season. If all are answered, Notre Dame could be on the path to greatness once again. Because after all, Christmas is the season for getting presents.\n\nMAKE BRIAN KELLY TAKE THE RAMS\u2019 JOB\n\nDid I put that in all capital letters? Oh, I didn\u2019t even notice. It was probably because I was yelling at my computer scream while I typed it.\n\nPlease oh please great gift giver, please make Brian Kelly the Las Angeles Rams\u2019 next head coach. There may not be the top head coaching options out there anymore, but Notre Dame deserves better.\n\nKelly has been a disaster in South Bend. Even with a National Championship appearance, he\u2019s made his time with Notre Dame nothing but a failure. When you have the recruiting classes Kelly put together, and the amount of talent already on the team, something positive has to happen. The man has had a first-round draft pick all but one year he\u2019s been at Notre Dame!\n\nNo one can tell me the failed attempt at glory has been anyone\u2019s fault except Kelly\u2019s. He\u2019s never been able to run a team and has lost almost the entire Irish fanbase after this season.\n\nIf I could have just one thing for Christmas this year, it\u2019d be that Brian Kelly moves on to the NFL. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s good in LA, or if he makes Jared Goff and Todd Gurley \u201cThe Greatest Show on Turf\u201d part two. All I want is a new start in Notre Dame, one without Brian Kelly.\n\nLet Brandon Wimbush be as good as he looks\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m thrilled Notre Dame\u2019s quarterback next season is Brandon Wimbush. Watching this kid play in high school was looking at a man amongst boys.\n\nHe can do it all. His arm is phenomenal, he can fit a ball through almost any window, and the speed, oh the speed. Wimbush is the future of Notre Dame. With two years of learning from Malik Zaire and DeShone Kizer on his resume, he has every opportunity to step into the starting role and be incredible right out of the gate.\n\nThere\u2019s always a lot of hype on quarterbacks, though. There\u2019s so many great play callers who are also freakish athletes, that people tend to group them all together. If you can throw and run, you\u2019re automatically great.\n\nBut Wimbush is more than the average player. Watching him play since his senior year in high school, you can tell he\u2019s special. My only concern is his adaptation to college. He\u2019s only got two games of experience and was used entirely as a running threat.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Notre Dame needs this. Us Irish fans have been promised success year after year, and have been given disappointment after disappointment. With Wimbush, the future looks bright again. Please, don\u2019t let us be let down.\n\nLet Jaylon Smith be Healthy\n\nBring world peace and food to all the poor. Like everyone else, I believe there are always people who need more than you do, no matter who you are. So please great gift giver, bring peace to this Earth.\n\nOh, and make Jaylon Smith the freakish athlete he once was, again. Thanks.\n\n2-Time Butkus Award Winner\n\n34th Overall NFL Draft Pick@dallascowboys Linebacker Jaylon Smith's Top ND Highlights: pic.twitter.com/UId1V6tQvG \u2014 The Fighting Irish (@FightingIrish) May 2, 2016\n\nEveryone knows that former Notre Dame linebacker, Jaylon Smith, would have been one of the best rookies of the 2016 class if he didn\u2019t get injured in the Fiesta Bowl last season. But, after a drop to the second-round of the 2016 draft, and missing most of this year, there\u2019s only one thing to ask for now \u2013 Make Smith great again.\n\nThis applied to way than Notre Dame fans. This wish is for Dallas Cowboy fans and just about everyone that loves quality football.\n\nIn three years at Notre Dame, Smith recorded 284 tackles. There was no sign this tackling machine was ever going to be anything short of amazing until his knee injury. In the NFL, no one actually believes he isn\u2019t going to be a star once he gets the chance.\n\nSo, all I\u2019m asking for is to give him a chance. If Jaylon Smith can be healthy once again, the sky is the limit. I\u2019m one who genuinely believes that by the time his career is over, he\u2019ll be one of the greatest linebackers ever to play. The only thing standing in his way, one injury.\n\n12 wins in the 2017 regular season\n\nEveryone wants the same thing. As a football fan, no matter who you root for, you want one thing for your team, and that\u2019s to win. Well great gift giver, bring Notre Dame 12 wins in 2017.\n\nAn undefeated year is a lot to ask for, I know. But c\u2019mon, it\u2019s been so long since the Fighting Irish have finished where they were expected to. Just one undefeated year would relieve so much stress among players, fans, and the coaching staff. I guarantee, no one gets fired if Notre Dame goes 12-0 next year.\n\nDid you ever see the \u2018Family Guy\u2019 episode when Peter, Quagmire, Joe, and Cleveland find God so he can make the Patriots win again? Well, Notre Dame has a solid quarterback, one of the best rushers in the nation, an incredible receiving core, and hopefully a more experienced defense. I\u2019m almost positive the only thing stopping them from winning is a higher power.\n\nI mean, we deserve it. Notre Dame has been through more than just about any team in college football this season. All we want is one season to feel like Alabama. Maybe keep the games a little closer, so they aren\u2019t as boring, but if that\u2019s asking too much than don\u2019t even worry about it.\n\nA National Championship is what everyone wants, but if you put us in a situation to get there, we can\u2019t be upset. Please, just give the Irish the season they should\u2019ve had for the last three years.\n\nStop the disappointment\n\nTo sum up my entire wishlist, bring joy to South Bend. Just stop the disappoint, stop the losing, and stop the nonsense. Notre Dame is one of the most prestigious college football teams in the country, bring it back to where it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nHow do you feel Notre Dame??? Credit \u2013 Brent Henderson pic.twitter.com/kmi8MVFPcW \u2014 Crying Jordan (@CryingJordan) September 24, 2016\n\nNotre Dame fans aren\u2019t like Browns fan. We don\u2019t forget what it\u2019s like to win or give up on the season before it even begins. And we aren\u2019t Golden State Warrior fans, feeling like our team just handed us the biggest slap in the face we\u2019ve ever experienced as a sports fan.\n\nWe\u2019re Notre Dame fans, the people who hear all year long about the talent and potential our team has. The ones who sit through games where championship hopes are on the line, only to lose and crush our dreams.\n\nThere\u2019s no worse feeling than knowing you\u2019re a few weeks away from the College Football Playoff and watching your team melt away. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\nWe\u2019ve sat through an embarrassing National Championship game. A game against Florida State that was ours for only a second, just to have it ripped from our hands as we stopped celebrating a play we\u2019ll never forget. And now this. A season that was ours for the taking, and turned into one of the most humiliating years in program history.\n\nNo one knows what we\u2019ve been through. So, please, bring us joy. All Irish fans really want this holiday season, is the disappointment to end.\n\nThis article originally appeared on",

    "text": "The Traffic Scotland National Control Centre is fully operational with Storm Barbara\u2019s effects being felt over Scotland.\n\nTransport Minister Humza Yousaf has chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government\u2019s Resilience Team this morning (Friday) where he was given an update on stormy conditions and their impact.\n\nThe Met Office is warning that Scotland will be subjected to severe weather for the rest of this week and into next week with strong winds, heavy rain and wintry showers all featuring. The worst of the conditions today are expected over the far north of the country and the Western and Northern Isles where an Amber alert is force today. The unsettled conditions are expected to remain with a further Amber alert for Storm Conor now issued for the far north on Boxing Day.\n\nThe effects are being felt on the transport system as people make their way home for the festive season. Operators do not take the decision to cancel services lightly but the safety of passengers and crew is the top priority.\n\nOn the ferries, as expected cancellations are in place and operators have been proactively contacting customers to make them aware. We are also expecting revised schedules and cancellations of flights to the islands. The situation is replicated on the railways, where a revised timetable is in place.\n\nThe trunk road network is coping well so far with some restrictions and maybe even temporary closures on bridges expected across the day. The Skye, Kessock and Dornoch crossings will be the most susceptible. The operating companies have specialist equipment in place to help deal with flooding and our TRISS teams are stationed across the network to assist with any debris on the network.\n\nLinks to all of the information have been pulled together on the Traffic Scotland website and people are being urged to check the latest on conditions before they go.\n\nResponder authorities and essential services such as telecoms, electricity, water and gas in the areas affected are activating their plans to deal with the potential impacts and extra staffing and on call arrangements are in place over the festive period.\n\nSEPA have seven flood alerts in place covering Caithness and Sutherland, Dumfries and Galloway, Orkney, Scottish Borders, Shetland, Skye and Lochaber and the Western Isles.\n\nTransport Minister Humza Yousaf said: \u201cMinisters have been receiving regular updates on the impact of the severe weather across this week and I wanted to be at the Traffic Control Centre this morning to monitor preparations for myself.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting the worst of the disruption today when winds are expected to reach 90 mph.\n\n\u201cOur transport operators and trunk road operating companies are working hard to keep services and roads running, safety has to be our top priority so we are seeing delays and cancellations to flights and ferries. There are some alterations to train timetables with full details on the Scotrail website.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen more traditional winter weather with snow and ice on higher roads and our gritters and patrols have been out across the network - our gritter tracker shows where they have been in action. Our TRISS teams are stationed at strategic points on the network and our electronic signing is warning drivers of the likely hazards.\n\n\u201cWe would urge everyone to check the latest sources of information before they travel and keep in mind that the situation can change quickly. They should leave plenty time to get to where they need to be and the transport operators are doing what they can to help people arrive at their destinations and get any last minute festive shopping done safely.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe shall be continuing to monitor the situation over the festive period including Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day to make sure that the most reliable and relevant information is being communicated to people as early as possible.\u201d",

    "text": "By JEN CARDINES\n\nSTAFF WRITER\n\nThe main dining hall in the Summit at Plantsville was transformed into a Christmas store for the annual Shops at Apple Town Villa event.\n\nOver the last decade, the Summit has provided its residents with a shopping experience like no other. Tables lined the room, filled with a multitude of offerings for the shoppers to choose from. All of the items came from community-wide donations to support the seniors living at the Summit.\n\nBarbara Blau, therapeutic recreation director, coordinates this annual event with the help of fellow staff members and volunteers.\n\n\u201cThe community has always been good, but this year was different,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just embraced us and donated so much.\u201d\n\nThe new and gently used items are all free of cost to the residents, and volunteers work a gift-wrapping station to complete the experience. Many seniors that live in the Summit cannot leave the facility, but with this event they are able to pick out gifts for their loved ones.\n\nPeople were also available to support the seniors who have impaired mobility, helping them navigate the Christmas store.\n\n\u201cThey start talking about it months in advance,\u201d Blau said. \u201cResidents that don\u2019t usually leave their rooms come out for this.\u201d\n\nThe residents aren\u2019t the only ones who got excited about the shopping experience. Denise Roy was on site to volunteer after reading a post in a local Facebook group. She took an extended lunch break from work to help with the event, eager to jump on board.\n\nAt the end of the day, whatever doesn\u2019t get picked by the shoppers goes to Southington Social Services for donation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for everyone,\u201d Blau said.",

    "title": "How to See a Meteor Shower During the Winter Solstice",
    "text": "View Images Stargazers gather on a cool New Mexico night for a laser-guided tour of the constellations.\n\nPhotograph by Alan Dyer, VWPics/AP\n\nThis week, two annual astronomical events will join forces to create a celestial double feature, as the Ursid meteor shower peaks during the winter solstice for northern sky-watchers.\n\nSeasons (and solstices) happen because our planet spins on an axis that is slightly tilted. During winter in the Northern Hemisphere, Earth\u2019s axis tilts away from the sun. On the day of the solstice, the sun takes its shortest path in the sky and hugs the horizon during its daily trek, making it the shortest day of the year.\n\nAt the same time, south of the Equator, the axis is tilted toward the sun, and people there are experiencing the height of summer. For sky-watchers in these regions, the December solstice is the longest day of the year.\n\nThe exact date and time of the December solstice changes slightly from year to year because of the difference between a calendar year of 365 days and the solar year of 365.26 days\u2014the exact time it takes for Earth to make one trip around the sun.\n\nThis year, the December solstice officially occurs at 5:44 a.m. ET (10:44 UTC) on Wednesday, December 21.\n\nMeteor Showers 101 Meteor showers bring interplanetary debris, ranging from pebbles to boulders, into Earth's atmosphere. Find out how these dazzling displays come about.\n\nBear Necessities\n\nOnce the solstice sun sets, the fun really begins for sky-watchers: A minor meteor shower is set to peak across northern skies later in the evening and into the predawn hours of Thursday, December 22.\n\nThe sand grain-size particles that slam into our atmosphere to create the Ursid shower were shed many centuries ago from the comet 8P/Tuttle. Every year like clockwork, sometime between December 17 and 23, Earth plows through the debris stream left behind by this icy visitor.\n\nThe Ursids were first noticed in Europe back in 1900, and they are known to produce about 10 to 15 shooting stars an hour, on average. Because of the shower\u2019s relatively low rates and cold winter timing, observing records have been sparse. Still, some keen stargazers have been surprised by rare bursts of 30 to a hundred meteors an hour.\n\nView Images Ursid meteors seem to radiate from the region of the sky near the Big Dipper.\n\nIllustration by A. Fazekas, SkySafari\n\nAs with all meteor showers, the Ursids are named after the constellation from which they appear to radiate\u2014in this case it\u2019s Ursa Minor, the little bear. Meteors will seem to shoot out from a region just to the left of the bowl of the Big Dipper, which will hang low in the northern sky for mid-latitude observers.\n\nWhile the Geminids last week were mostly washed out by a superbright full moon, the Ursids promise to put on a decent sky show well before the half-lit moon rises around 1 a.m. local time.\n\nObservers will have their best chance to catch the most meteors falling after local darkness sets in on the night of December 21. After moonrise, expect to see more modest meteor numbers flying across the skies\u2014somewhere around five to 10 an hour.\n\nSo if you are headed out to do any last-minute holiday shopping this week, you may get the chance to make a wish on an Ursid shooting star as it falls from the heavens.",

    "title": "David Simms on Sheffield Steelers: Potential success could rest on bust Christmas period",
    "text": "A big Christmas for the Steelers, well it is if they want to create history and become the first team to win three league championships in a row.\n\nTheir form to date has been outstanding, regarded by many to be the best and most dynamic team in the Elite League, however a built-in self-destruct system against Cardiff has resulted in five losses to date against the Welsh leaders and despite many games in hand the points deficit is still substantial.\n\nThe three series of games this Christmas starting with this week\u2019s double against Coventry, the annual duel with Nottingham and the New Years Eve and New Years Day games against Manchester may well decide where the title heads to this year.\n\nCan the Steelers clean sweep? Well the answer is yes they can, they are good enough when the stars align and everything clicks. However on nights when just one cog is out of line then trouble can come the way of Paul Thompson\u2019s side.\n\nThe Steelers keep creating but aren\u2019t bearing down and taking those chances, they aren\u2019t converting anywhere near enough. It does seem that every error leads to a goal against. Now that isn\u2019t a good combination.\n\nIt\u2019s a good job Jace Coyle was brought in early wasn\u2019t it? Andreas Valdix remains unavailable for another 2/3 weeks and now Jesse Schultz is a doubt after an injury against Cardiff. This is a period of six games in 10 days, a time when all hands are required on deck.\n\nValdix has been a massive loss, perhaps showing his value to the team when he was in it. Nelson and Dowd have missed their centre, Markus Nilsson has been fantastic covering as a centre playing with all three units but Levi and Robert need their Valdix back, and soon.\n\nNilsson in fact might have been our player of the first half of the year. His speed, tenacity and intelligence has meant that when injuries have occurred he has been used to cover in most situations. In any other team in our league he wouldn\u2019t be playing on the 4th line.\n\nHis work rate is sublime and his points output per minute played up there with the best.\n\nBoxing Day is looking like a sell out, only seats right behind the Steelers bench remain on sale, that\u2019s over 9,300 fans packing the Arena out for the festive game.\n\nThe Steelers v Panthers series remain the hot ticket, the local rivalry. We love it and nothing makes or breaks your Christmas like a win over the arch enemy. The Panthers have helped the Steelers recently, whilst Sheffield have had the better of the games played against Nottingham it is the Panthers that have taken valuable points off Cardiff. It\u2019s a strange league, a league that on any night can throw up unexpected results.\n\nOn our day other teams cant live with our speed and our transition. It is a new more European way of playing. It is taking time to get into the DNA of some but when it works its incredible. The Steelers must and will stick with it. Sure there will be nights when goals are given up but if we can be focussed and remain urgent around the net then success will follow.\n\nWe are just over a third of the way through the season, a long time to go, a lot of hockey to be played. Remember we are the team, the club that has been here before, won before. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we all had a great Christmas and that resulted in a very successful 2017.",

    "title": "25 Years On, Collapse of Soviet Union Still Brings Cheers\u2014and Tears",
    "text": "View Images A worker at a monument factory in Vilnius, Lithuania, sweeps dirt from a post-World War II bronze statue of Joseph Stalin.\n\nPhotograph by Larry Price, National Geographic Creative\n\n\u201cWe are living under the carcass of a dead cow, and it stinks,\u201d said Algimantas Cekuolis, a Lithuanian politician. \u201cThere are two electrodes attached to this carcass, and every once in a while it twitches. And that cow\u2019s name is Bolshevism.\u201d Cekuolis smiled as if he had just emptied stale beer into the sink.\n\nIt was 1990, only a few months before the carcass twitched its last\u2014when one of history\u2019s largest and most powerful empires died with a whimper. I was on assignment in the Baltic States for National Geographic when Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s policy of glasnost (free speech) first popped the bottle and released a thousand genies. Speech, indignation, and opinions billowed out like steam. (See Nat Geo pictures of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.)\n\nThe Soviet Union, technically based on the ideals of mutual aid and human camaraderie, had not flowered as planned in Russian soil. Those who ruled the Soviet Union distrusted and feared their citizens; the citizens, in turn, distrusted and feared their government. And yet this tenuous empire survived for nearly 70 years and three generations, dominating the 20th century. (Also see \"Why Many Young Russians See a Hero in Putin.\")\n\nThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) was forged by a band of left-wing radicals, the Bolsheviks, who led an armed attack on the Russian government in February 1917, storming the Tsar\u2019s winter palace in Petrograd, now known as St. Petersburg. It was first formalized in 1922, with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan as members. In 1940 it forcibly annexed the independent Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nA Narrow Escape\n\nI was born in Estonia during the Nazi occupation of the Baltics. In the summer of 1944 my family and I fled from the approaching Red Army along with thousands of other Baltic people. Many of us were crammed into German hospital ships and troop carriers heading west. Soviet dive-bombers sank one ship, the Moero, killing more than 1,500 people. When the Allied invasion of Europe reached Germany in 1945, we were waiting, hiding in the hayloft of a kind German farmer along with 20 Hungarians.\n\nIn the Estonia we left behind, the returning Soviets brutalized the population with a roundup of artists, teachers, intellectuals, and suspiciously successful farmers, eventually consigning more than 10,000 people to Siberian labor camps. In Ukraine, Soviet policies led to the starvation of millions. For the following 50 years the citizens of the Soviet Republics found themselves press-ganged to serve the interests of an experimental state led by Moscow. At the end of World War II the Soviets solidified another buffer zone of defense, seizing control of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Romania, and Bulgaria\u2014the final pieces of the \u201cSoviet Bloc.\u201d\n\nMost people in the Soviet Bloc, although deeply patriotic, found socialist life dispiriting and eventually pointless.\n\nMy five assignments in the Soviet Union for the Geographic were stimulating but often contentious. The Soviet agency assigned to aid foreign journalists, Novosti, was a fountain of misinformation. Reason held no currency against dogma; black was often offered as white. And, throughout its more than 70-year effort to retool human behavior, the keepers of the U.S.S.R. could never satisfactorily answer this fundamental question: If communism is a superior economic philosophy, why are so many people struggling to escape from communist nations, and none struggling to get in?\n\nMost people in the Soviet Bloc, although deeply patriotic, found socialist life dispiriting and eventually pointless. To ensure loyalty, the government inundated its people with alternate versions of history, the \u201cfake news\u201d of their day. But the contradictions between actual policy and the Soviet constitution, which promised abundant freedoms, were seldom hidden from view. Lies were blatant. Hypocrisy was part of the bureaucratic skill set. Neighbor reported on neighbor. In the Baltic States, border police raked the sand along the seashores each night so they could follow the trail of footprints left by would-be defectors.\n\nFall of the Wall\n\nThe most potent symbol of the Soviets\u2019 distrust of their citizens was the Berlin Wall, built in 1961 by Soviet-controlled East Germany (officially known as the German Democratic Republic, or GDR). The purpose of the wall was clear: to keep the people of the GDR in, and Western influence out. The Soviets called it the \u201canti-Fascist protective barrier.\u201d In the following decades nearly a hundred East Germans, attempting to breach the Wall and escape to the West, were gunned down by their own border police.\n\nAt its apex in the 1970s, the U.S.S.R. comprised nearly 300 million people and 100 distinct ethnic groups, stretching across 11 time zones on the largest landmass on Earth. It developed nuclear weapons, sent cosmonauts into space, and generated power, pride, and fear. As Soviet life softened in the 1970s and '80s, and advances in communications technology made it more difficult for the state to hide its flaws, Premier Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to stave off social revolution by granting glasnost (free speech) and perestroika (restructuring). The pot simmered.\n\nView Images National Geographic senior writer Priit Vesilind reported on the fall of the Berlin Wall in the magazine's April 1990 issue.\n\nNational Geographic Magazine\n\nNational Geographic Senior Writer Mike Edwards, assigned to cover Moscow in the late 1980s, found the change dramatic. \u201cEven five years ago you couldn\u2019t have a casual, candid conversation with an ordinary person,\u201d Edwards told a Geographic archivist. \u201cIt just would not happen. He would be terrified to be seen talking to a foreigner. Now you get to Moscow and people can\u2019t stop talking to you. They want to tell you how bad life is. The frustration that builds up in people, and the anger that builds up standing in line for hours\u2014200 people standing in line to buy ten eggs. And so you find people screaming at each other. Sometimes fist fights.\u201d\n\nOn November 9, 1989, a colleague at National Geographic headquarters in Washington came charging down the hall with news that West Germans were literally dancing on top of the Berlin Wall by the Brandenburg Gate. Twelve hours later I was in Germany, hustling toward the gap in the Wall at Invaliden Street, where a small bridge spanned the River Spree. Moving toward me in the near darkness were families with small children, mothers pushing strollers, teenagers dressed in pre-washed jeans, businessmen in shabby suits. All streaming through the open gate.\n\nThe reality nearly knocked me to my knees, and I sat down and wept. They were East Germans, yes, but in my mind they were also Estonians and Ukrainians, Russians and Armenians. Crowds of jubilant West Germans applauded and shouted welcome, pressing flowers into the hands of their brothers and sisters. Geographic photographers David Harvey, Jim Nachtwey, and Anthony Suau documented one of history\u2019s most dramatic moments.\n\nFree at Last\n\nThe tide spread quickly. In 1991, during an attempted coup by hardline Communist legislators to keep the Soviet Union together, Russian President Boris Yeltsin climbed onto a military tank in Moscow\u2019s Red Square to denounce the coup and yank the Russian Republic out of the Union. Within days, the 12 other constituent republics of the empire, from Estonia in the north to Moldova in the south, followed the Russian defection and declared independence.\n\nA raw period of elation, optimism, chaos, corruption, and unregulated capitalism followed the fall of the empire. Oligarchs and con men erected their own castles, and vendors flush with black-market consumables clogged the streets of Moscow. Dissidents and intellectuals celebrated freedom, but much of the Russian population considered free market capitalism a gift that came without an operator\u2019s manual.\n\nNow we mark the 25th year since the end of what U.S. President Ronald Reagan called the \u201cEvil Empire\u201d in 1984. But when former KGB agent Vladimir Putin consolidated power in Russia 20 years later, he lamented the fall of the Soviet Union as \u201cthe most catastrophic event of the 20th century.\u201d And the Russian people, humiliated by their fall from global prominence, once again lean toward authoritarian governance and the nostalgic rituals of the Russia Orthodox Church.\n\nSome say the winds of change in post-empire Russia have stoked the fire beneath Western nations that long for economic and social stability. Others lament that the world is shifting toward a stingy isolationism, erecting new walls and uplifting potential strongmen to high office. Empires rise and fall, and few retain their luster. But the demise of the Soviet Union, though now lamented in some quarters, ended a bitter, misguided chapter in human endeavor.",

    "text": "Bio Roundup: Crazy \u201916, Trials of \u201917, Senate on Drugs & More\n\nXconomy National \u2014\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen the Internet memes. \u201cWhen 2016 started, I looked like this. [Insert picture of young Leo DiCaprio.] Now I look like this. [Leo, with mountain beard, after mud-wrestling with a grizzly in The Revenant.]\u201d In life science terms, let\u2019s just say all our telomeres feel a lot shorter than 12 months ago.\n\nThe biggest issues of 2016 are also the biggest questions of 2017: What do the Trump administration and Republican-led Congress have in store for federal health initiatives, laws, and agency budgets? Will government and public pressure force change on drug prices? Or will drug makers and insurers proactively adopt new schemes that preserve profits and the public good?\n\nEarly this year, the circus hit full tilt when Martin Shkreli smirked his way through a Congressional hearing on price gouging. More executive grilling followed. (The Associated Press reported last month that \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d hasn\u2019t had much impact.)\n\nSo it seems appropriate that we\u2019re ending the year with a Senate price-gouging report slamming Shkreli and his former companies, Retrophin and Turing Pharmaceuticals.\n\nCutting-edge biomedical research, once out of the lab, hit hurdles in 2016. A leading microbiome program to combat deadly C. difficile infections failed a major trial that could have led to a landmark approval.\n\nIn cancer immunotherapy, one leading developer of CAR-T cell therapies, Novartis (NYSE: NVS), dismantled its research group, even while pressing toward FDA approval of its lead product for kids with leukemia. The approval could come next year, as could approval for a lymphoma CAR-T therapy from Kite Pharma (NASDAQ: KITE).\n\nAnother top CAR-T developer, Juno Therapeutics (NASDAQ: JUNO), revealed in 2016 that five people died while taking its most advanced experimental therapy. Officials earlier this month could not explain why the therapy was causing the deadly brain swelling.\n\nThe new year will also bring gene editing news. Patent judges could issue a decision about the ownership of CRISPR-Cas9, while a few trials using the breakthrough technology could begin. But new versions of CRISPR are in the works and might eventually make the original Cas9 patents a footnote.\n\nFor pre-holiday developments on all these fronts, and more, let\u2019s get to the roundup. Happy holidays, everyone.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\n\u2014In a two-part series, Xconomy previewed several key clinical studies expected to produce data in 2017 and possibly shape healthcare in the years to come. Part one digs into trials in hemophilia, cystic fibrosis and heart disease, among others. Part two looks at studies in Zika infection, migraines, multiple sclerosis, and more.\n\n\u2014Along with the Senate\u2019s drug-pricing report, a group of Democrats and independents in the chamber urged Trump to help reform drug prices. Another Democratic senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, called for a new \u201cwar on drugs\u201d\u2014namely, prescription painkillers that have ravaged communities across the country. The Los Angeles Times reported that the maker of Oxycontin turned to overseas markets when U.S. prescriptions began to fall.\n\n\u2014Cambridge, MA-based Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) stayed in-house to replace departing CEO George Scangos. Michel Vounatsos, a Merck veteran who joined Biogen as chief commercial officer earlier this year, will take over Jan. 6. He said he would make Biogen more \u201cefficient\u201d and pump up its core multiple sclerosis franchise.\n\n\u2014Looking beyond the CRISPR-Cas9 patent fight, the Broad Institute sold an exclusive license for a new type of CRISPR to Editas Medicine (NASDAQ: EDIT), which has close ties to the Broad\u2019s top gene edit researcher Feng Zhang. Meanwhile, the Broad\u2019s CRISPR patent rival, UC Berkeley, said that its scientists have found new CRISPR elements in microbes dug out of soil, mines, and geysers.\n\n\u2014In a week in which New York City and state governments pledged $1.15 billion to boost the local life sciences industry, Xconomy held New York Life Sciences 2021 to hear from local industry experts about shaping New York\u2019s biotech future. Here are a few takeaways and photos.\n\nPARP-MANIA\n\n\u2014Clovis Oncology (NASDAQ: CLVS) won FDA approval of rucaparib (Rubraca) for advanced ovarian cancer patients with a specific genetic signature. Clovis announced a price of $165,000 per patient per year. The approval is the latest of a so-called \u201cPARP\u201d inhibitor, which are being tested in a variety of cancers.\n\n\u2014Meanwhile, the FDA began a priority review\u2014faster than usual\u2014of Tesaro\u2019s (NASDAQ: TSRO) rival PARP blocker niraparib and said it wouldn\u2019t convene a panel of outside experts to debate the drug\u2019s merits\u2014a positive sign for niraparib\u2019s approval chances. The agency will make a decision by June 30.\n\nROCHE DATA AND MORE\n\n\u2014While experimental gene therapies for hemophilia have attracted attention this year, other drugs continue through the clinic. The Roche empire (including Genentech and Chugai) this week reported positive data in the first of three Phase 3 trials for emicizumab. The drug is meant for the subset of hemophilia A patients who develop immune responses, or \u201cinhibitors,\u201d to current treatments.\n\n\u2014The FDA will delay three months to make its approval decision on ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), a multiple sclerosis treatment from Roche\u2019s Genentech group. Data from recent trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u2014San Diego\u2019s Acadia Pharmaceuticals reported positive Phase 2 data for its drug pimavanserin in a study of psychosis related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u2014Shares of Cambridge-based Merrimack Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MACK) fell 18 percent after the company stopped a Phase 2 breast cancer trial early. The drug MM-302 was unlikely to benefit patients.\n\nPRE-CHRISTMAS DEALS\n\n\u2014San Antonio-based Acelity sold its LifeCell regenerative medicines unit to Allergan (NYSE: AGN) for $2.9 billion.\n\n\u2014Otsuka Pharmaceutical committed $265 million to Cambridge, MA-based Akebia Therapeutics (NASDAQ: AKBA) to help fund Phase 3 trials of anemia pill vadadustat.\n\n\u2014Novartis will pay $50 million upfront to Conatus Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CNAT) for rights to develop the fatty liver disease drug emricasan if Conatus successfully brings it through Phase 2 studies.\n\n\u2014New York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) paid U.K.-based PsiOxus Therapeutics $50 million up front for rights to a type of cancer therapy called an oncolytic virus\u2014engineered to invade and kill tumor cells\u2014called NG-348.\n\n\u2014Five months after Tokai Pharmaceuticals\u2019s (NASDAQ: TKAI) prostate cancer drug failed a Phase 3 trial, the company agreed to sell most of its shares to privately held Otic Pharma, which will rebrand Tokai as a developer of drugs for ear, nose, and throat disorders.\n\n\u2014Summit, NJ-based Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG) picked up an option to acquire an experimental cancer drug, MSC-1, from Toronto startup Northern Biologics.

    "title": "As Groundwater Dwindles, a Global Food Shock Looms",
    "text": "View Images Center-pivot irrigation systems irrigate fields of grain in Finney County, Kansas. Each well draws hundreds of gallons per minute from the sinking Ogallala aquifer.\n\nPhotograph by Randy Olson, National Geographic Creative\n\nRising temperatures and growing demands for thirsty grains like rice and wheat could drain much of the world\u2019s groundwater in the next few decades, new research warns.\n\nNearly half of our food comes from the warm, dry parts of the planet, where excessive groundwater pumping to irrigate crops is rapidly shrinking the porous underground reservoirs called aquifers. Vast swaths of India, Pakistan, southern Europe, and the western United States could face depleted aquifers by midcentury, a recent study finds \u2014 taking a bite out of the food supply and leaving as many as 1.8 billion people without access to this crucial source of fresh water.\n\nTo forecast when and where specific aquifers around the globe might be drained to the point that they\u2019re unusable, Inge de Graaf, a hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado, developed a new model simulating regional groundwater dynamics and withdrawals from 1960 to 2100. She found that California\u2019s agricultural powerhouses \u2014 the Central Valley, Tulare Basin and southern San Joaquin Valley, which produce a plentiful portion of the nation\u2019s food \u2014 could run out of accessible groundwater as early as the 2030s. India\u2019s Upper Ganges Basin and southern Spain and Italy could be used up between 2040 and 2060. And the southern part of the Ogallala aquifer under Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico could be depleted between 2050 and 2070.\n\n\u201cThe areas that will run into trouble the soonest are areas where we have a lot of demand and not enough surface water available,\u201d says de Graaf, who presented her results last week at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco.\n\nFarming has mushroomed across arid regions like these in the past half-century. With scarce rains and few rivers and lakes, they depend on water pumped up from underground. Since 1960, excessive pumping has already used up enough groundwater worldwide to nearly fill Lake Michigan, estimates de Graaf, who projects that with climate change and population growth, future groundwater use will soar. She considers an aquifer depleted when its water level falls below a depth of around 300 feet, at which point it becomes too expensive for most users to pump up.\n\nShrinking groundwater supplies will dent the world\u2019s food supply, says de Graaf's co-author Marc Bierkens, a hydrologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Bierkens points out that 40 percent of global food production now relies on irrigation with groundwater. If the amount of available groundwater were cut in half, for example, he estimates that farm output would drop by roughly 6 percent\u2014reflecting the portion that\u2019s absolutely dependent on unsustainable groundwater use.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the whole population will starve,\u201d says Bierkens, \u201cbut it will have an impact on the food chain and food prices.\u201d\n\nWater Mining\n\nGroundwater depletion affects more than food: It also damages wetlands, makes land sink, and contributes to sea-level rise.\n\nA 2015 study based on satellite observations showed that most of the world\u2019s largest aquifers\u201421 out of 37\u2014are being drained faster than they can refill. \u201cA number of studies point to the overuse of groundwater and the tremendous risk that our water and food security are under,\u201d says water scientist Jay Famiglietti of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who led the satellite study. \u201cThe problem is, we don\u2019t know how much groundwater is left.\u201d\n\nDe Graaf\u2019s study begins to address that problem for regional aquifers. In normal conditions, those layers of sand or porous rock are recharged by water from rain, snow, or streams seeping down through the ground. But recharge can\u2019t keep up with today\u2019s furious pace of pumping, especially in areas that receive little precipitation.\n\nAgriculture is by far the leading groundwater user, and overexploitation is on the rise. The volume of groundwater depletion climbed 22 percent in the past decade, with nearly all of it going to watering crops, according to another study presented at the San Francisco conference.\n\nFully 20 percent of agricultural irrigation is now unsustainable, University College London researcher Carole Dalin reported. Nearly half goes to commercial crops of wheat and rice. And Pakistan, India and the United States are responsible for two-thirds of that outsized groundwater use.\n\nStudies like these show how today\u2019s unsustainable practices jeopardize the future of our planet\u2019s aquifers, says Thomas Harter, a University of California, Davis hydrologist who studies California\u2019s Central Valley, but was not involved in either project.\n\nHarter doubts, however, that the Central Valley will run out of groundwater in 2030. Although the region\u2019s aquifer has been ravaged by decades of rampant pumping \u2014 made even worse by the recent statewide drought \u2014 conservation can still help save this vital resource, he says. The state recently passed a groundwater management act requiring local water agencies to devise sustainable use plans, and giving them the authority to curtail runaway pumping.",

    "text": "LEWISVILLE, Texas \u2013 Devin Cammack had no idea what was in store for him when he arrived to work on Sunday.\n\nThe 31-year-old pizza delivery driver had been called into work early and was dispatched to Victorious Life Church in Lewisville. Slightly confused by the directions, he arrived early and waiting patiently at the rear of the church.\n\nDevin was then called to the stage during a Christmas play by the lead character played by David Hira, who as part of the script, had ordered a pizza.\n\n\u201cHe came down the aisle,\u201d David said, \u201cI sat him down and said \u2018There\u2019s something big going on in your life, you have a life changing event coming up.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn shock, Devin stared blankly, he recalled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, huh, what, how do you know this,\u201d Devin said.\n\nHe was then asked to share his story with the congregation.\n\nTwo years ago, the father of three was diagnosed with end-stage heart failure. He would need a pump implanted into his chest that does 90-percent of the resting workload of the heart. Because the pump needs 24-hour power, Devin has to wear a battery pack when he is out of the house, and must be plugged in when home.\n\n\u201cI need this to live,\u201d Devin said, patting the pack. \u201cAnd medication.\u201d\n\nAfter sharing his story on stage, the magic started.\n\n\u201cEveryone got up out of their seats and came up to us and dropped money in the hat,\u201d he said. \u201c$1,456.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the surprising tip amount Devin received for his pizza delivery from congregants at victorious life.\n\n\u201cThe world is good.it is full of goodness and kindness and people are just waiting to be able to express that in some way and be witness to that,\u201d said David. \u201cIt was phenomenal.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s more. On Monday, Devin got word from his doctor that he no longer needs a heart transplant because his treatment is working and his heart is beginning to return to a more manageable size. He will still require his implant for a while longer and lifelong medication.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing, one of the most humbling experiences in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really truly was.\u201d\n\nThe church\u2019s Worship Leader Noel Pearce, who wrote and directed the event, said the generous tip was spontaneous.\n\n\u201cI was like, wow, this is the true meaning of Christmas,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted the play to spread the message about the gift of giving.\n\n\u201cThe show was, \u2018To Believe Again\u2019 and they (congregates) were believing again in the whole purpose of Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the whole purpose of Christmas, the whole reason of Christmas, is to give.\u201d\n\nNoel also had a hand in getting Devin to the church that Sunday. When he contacted a nearby Pizza Hut to set up the order, he chatted with the store\u2019s manager and asked for help. On Saturday, another driver was given around $300 to help replace what taken when his wallet was recently stolen. Adding to Sunday\u2019s collection were students from the Lewisville High School choir who were waiting in the wings until their performance.\n\n\u201cWhen the kids started coming out and wanted to give, it was so touching,\u201d Noel said. \u201cIt was truly an amazing moment just to see all those people give.\u201d\n\nDevin said the unexpected donation has allowed him to fix his car and pay rent early. The gift lifted the burden, if ever so slightly, of living paycheck to paycheck, and paying out-of-pocket for his health insurance.\n\n\u201cI will never forget this. And I will never forget any of these people,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I can breathe.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 WFAA",

    "title": "JK Rowling gave 'blast of reality' on Jeremy Corbyn, says Labour MP",
    "text": "Frank Field has written to JK Rowling to thank her for a \u201cblast of reality\u201d after she tweeted her frustration over the probable re-election of Jeremy Corbyn, claiming the party will not laugh in the future because \u201cthis isn\u2019t bloody funny\u201d.\n\nThe Labour MP told the children\u2019s author she had \u201chit the nail on the head, and not for the first time, about Corbyn\u201d.\n\nIn a letter from his parliamentary office, Field wrote of his party leader: \u201cIt is remarkable he has got half a million new members. If he could spell out how this becomes a social movement, rather than an execution squad of Labour MPs, and ties in with what political parties do to try and win elections, then we will be a step forward.\u201d\n\nThe message comes after Rowling, who has more than 8 million followers, triggered a huge response from supporters of the Labour leader, who attacked her tweets, and others who backed her.\n\nOne message that Rowling retweeted called her a \u201cbillionaire centralist not a persecuted leftie\u201d.\n\n\n\nJ.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) One day in the far distant future we'll look back and we WONT LAUGH, LABOUR, BECAUSE THIS ISN'T BLOODY FUNNY.\n\nRowling did not refrain from hitting back at her critics, responding to one person who asked her what she did when she couldn\u2019t sleep with: \u201cTry to stop thinking about Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d\n\nTo another, who called her a \u201cfilthy liberal\u201d, she replied that the far left and right shared a dislike of decadent liberals.\n\nShe also tweeted about the amount of support she had received, referring to \u201cbeautiful messages\u201d, including from Corbyn supporters. To one person who called on Rowling\u2019s critics to \u201cstop hating\u201d, the author responded with a promise to stay put.\n\n\n\nJ.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) The far left & far right share many things, like a loathing of 'decadent' liberals #FilthyAndProudOfIt pic.twitter.com/y7lxk9naqf\n\nJ.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) To everyone who has sent me truly beautiful messages in the last few hours (including some Corbyn supporters), thank you xxx\n\nJ.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) I'm going nowhere! Little known fact about filthy bourgeois neoliberal centrists - we're tougher than you'd think ;) https://t.co/Sbe3Lwrq0l\n\nRowling has been an outspoken critic of Corbyn for a while, and has tried to support the Saving Labour movement, which is backing Owen Smith in the leadership contest. Her intervention came as pressure groups within the Labour movement clashed in a war of words over the leadership campaign.\n\nRichard Angell, director of Progress \u2013 a Labour pressure group that is critical of the Corbyn membership and whose members are seen as Blairite \u2013 has written an excoriating article for his group\u2019s magazine.\n\nHe accuses Momentum, a movement on the left of the party that is backing Corbyn, of planning to split Labour after September\u2019s election result.\n\n\u201cThis is not a party in a party, but a party waiting to leave a party,\u201d writes Angell in a message that will appear in his group\u2019s magazine on Thursday.\n\n\u201cJust look. Its national executive, trade union affiliations, membership processes, its conference alongside Labour conference and data on Labour members \u2013 harvested by the private companies set up to run Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaigns \u2013 all look like the precursor to an asset-strip of the Labour party.\u201d\n\nAngell said that it was a difficult and unpleasant time for \u201cmoderates\u201d in the Labour party.\n\n\u201cBut look how often the \u2018Mr Reasonable\u2019 mask slips from John McDonnell\u2019s face,\u201d he wrote about the shadow chancellor, before also claiming that when the party released a rights at work policy \u201cthe leader\u2019s office threatened in the media to sack party staff\u201d.\n\nThe reference appears to be to the row between Corbyn and Labour\u2019s general secretary, Iain McNicol.\n\nJK Rowling and the Angry Corbynites \u2013 truly a Twitter row for our times | Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan Read more\n\nAngell suggested that Momentum was \u201cfrustrated that taking over the party is not as easy as it hoped. Why? Because members like you remember how proud you felt the day the national minimum wage became law and, at a stroke, 1.5 million people \u2013 two-thirds of them women \u2013 got a pay rise; because members like you want to see something similar again.\u201d\n\nHe concluded that the Tories were bad enough to lose, but said Labour had to be good enough to win.\n\nHe also criticised a new NEC member, Rhea Wolfson, for doing her first interview with Solidarity, the newspaper of Worker\u2019s Liberty, a socialist group banned by Labour in 1990, and for supporting \u201cmandatory reselections\u201d of MPs.\n\nAngell said he had originally invited Momentum to be a partner of Progress but was annoyed that it let in non-Labour members. \u201cIt should rule out any support for deselections or a change of the rules for mandatory reselection \u2013 you cannot debate the future of the party and country with a political gun to your head,\u201d he added.\n\nA spokesman for Corbyn\u2019s campaign said: \u201cWe would encourage Richard Angell to engage in a constructive debate rather than construct straw man arguments and indulge in personal attacks on his fellow members. It\u2019s regrettable, although expected, that Richard feels this way.\u201d\n\nHe argued that Corbyn had reached out to all sections of the membership, citing a YouGov poll that gave the leader a huge lead over his rival, Smith.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring as many people into our party as possible to help us elect a Labour government,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we also want to be a pluralist and inclusive party, which is why Jeremy spoke at the Progress conference earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to argue for the policies that will transform and rebuild Britain so that no one and no community is left behind.\u201d\n\nA Momentum spokesman said: \u201cMomentum is absolutely committed to pluralism within the Labour party and had invited Progress to run joint campaigns twice \u2013 on voter registration and in support of election candidates, offers that were refused on both occasions. It is also bizarre for Richard Angell to attack Rhea Wolfson for giving an interview to an organisation whose recent national conference was addressed by both Richard Angell himself and unsuccessful Progress-backed NEC candidate Luke Akehurst.\u201d",

    "text": "I hope all our readers have a very Happy Christmas.\n\nAn important part of that, I\u2019m sure, will be the accumulation of presents delivered by a cheerful chubby chap in a red-and-white costume, travelling on a sleigh pulled by reindeer, and booming \u201cHo ho ho\u201d. No number of strikes and walkouts by airline or railway or postal staff will stop him because he\u2019s been at it for 200 years now (I was going to say 2,000 but then I looked it up and discovered he didn\u2019t appear \u2018til the reign of Henry VIII and was given a major revival by the Victorians). He\u2019s got stocking-filling down to a fine art by now, and one can only hope he\u2019ll survive Brexit\u2019s potential assault on the Elf and Safety conditions in his workshop (Ok, I\u2019ll get my coat). He\u2019ll make it to every corner of the globe and squeeze down the chimney of just about every house on earth \u2013 even though loads of them don\u2019t have chimneys \u2013 and, unlike the Royal Mail or Parcelforce, all of his gifts will arrive there by the morning of December 25.\n\nAnd you know who will be responsible for that? Rudolph and his friends, perhaps? Well no, and not just because Rudolph came late to the party, some time in the 20th century (much to the annoyance of Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen). No. The person responsible was me.\n\nI have already prepared a press release, for distribution to every global media outlet, in which I will claim responsibility for the safe arrival of every Christmas present in the world. \u201cWhere is your proof?\u201d I hear you ask. \u201cWhy do you want proof?\u201d I reply. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that we are living in the post-truth age (whatever that means, and I\u2019m still not sure) and if I say I\u2019m responsible, who are you to question me? I am here in my safe space (or \u201cgrotto\u201d as I prefer to call it) and it is my inalienable right to claim responsibility for anything I choose because if I can\u2019t be a poor sensitive snowflake at this time of year, then what\u2019s the point of all that branding for which Christmas has become so famous; even if you\u2019re celebrating it in Australia where you\u2019re as likely to find a snowman as you are to throw some prawns on the barbie in Bethnal Green on December 25.\u201d So I shall be issuing a statement claiming responsibility for the successful delivery of Christmas presents the world over. What\u2019s more, it is the global media\u2019s responsibility to print it. After all \u2013 and here, eventually, is the point \u2013 there is a precedent.\n\nIt seems to me that these days the media will print any kind of uncorroborated claim, just so long as it conforms to what everyone wants to hear. \u201cReferees are all biased against my team!\u201d \u2013 that would be Jose Mourinho, even if he hasn\u2019t actually said it (although he probably has). \u201cJeremy Corbyn hates Britain and loves terrorists!\u201d \u2013 that would be The Daily Mail (or, more likely, a Labour MP). \u201cDonald Trump is a dangerous lunatic!\u201d \u2013 actually that may be the odd one out. And when innocent people get killed by atrocities in the Western world, well we all know who to blame (even if we can\u2019t be sure until we actually catch the culprit), so let\u2019s go ahead and print it. What are they gonna do if it\u2019s wrong \u2013 sue?\n\nPersonally, I think we should take a bit more care before we print these claims. Call me old-fashioned but I think it would be a good idea to check that they\u2019re actually true. When, long ago, I worked late shifts on the Standard, we used to field a lot of late-night calls on the Newsdesk. By instinct, as we answered the phone, we would glance at the clock and, if it was between 11pm and midnight, as it usually was, because pubs closed strictly at 11 in those days, we would nod sagely at one another, roll our eyes, pick up a pencil and pad just in case, and prepare ourselves for a slurred outburst upon the wrongs of the world, the evils of the Government of the day and the newspaper we worked for, the meaning of life or the likelihood of there being a God, life after death, or ever seeing Spurs win the league. Quite often, these well-refreshed callers would be responding to something they had read in the newspaper and be keen to offer a new perspective on it, one that might have been found at the bottom of a glass shortly before closing time. Frequently they would wish to claim some sort of responsibility.\n\nAlready tired at the end of a long shift on the Newsdesk, we would listen patiently to the rambling caller or, more often, put the telephone receiver down and get on with some important work, like ordering a curry or checking the football results, until the chatter drew to a close. So frequent were these calls that it was hard to take anyone seriously which is why, on one occasion at around midnight, I put the phone down on a man claiming to be Screaming Lord Sutch, late lamented founder of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, making the improbable claim that a public convenience had just exploded while he was sitting on the loo. I\u2019m not sure I ever mentioned this to my News Editor after Scotland Yard later confirmed the veracity of his claim, but the point is that I had no way of confirming that it really was the 3rd Earl of Harrow on the other end of the line so I used my judgment to consider the likelihood of it being true.\n\nAnd I learned a valuable lesson: always check a story before you print it (or in this case, don\u2019t print it). It\u2019s pretty much the first rule of journalism. Without it we would be lost, publishing all kinds of rumour and hearsay. Which is why I found it so odd that every news outlet all over the world was so quick to publish a claim of responsibility for the Berlin truck atrocity this week, without a shred of evidence that it was true. Because it\u2019s exactly what we wanted to hear. More to the point, it\u2019s exactly what the people claiming responsibility wanted us to think: that they\u2019re so powerful they can strike at any time, any place. Printing it maintains their aura of power, and our own aura of fear. Without propaganda in the Western media, they are nothing.\n\nI think it\u2019s about time our friends in the Middle East (and I use the word \u201cfriends\u201d non-pejoratively, in the colloquial Corbyn sense of the word) came up with some proof to back up their claims, so that when they say they did something they just saw on the TV news, we know they\u2019re not making it up for publicity purposes. Otherwise we\u2019ll get ourselves into some terrible sort of situation where they get the \u201ccredit\u201d \u2013 I know, I know, but that\u2019s how they see it \u2013 for everything murdery that goes on in the West and we\u2019ll start to think they\u2019re much more powerful and important than they really are. For all we know, \u201cthey\u201d might be a bloke from Bradford stuck in a burned-out basement in Mosul with a not-very-smartphone and a dodgy mobile signal trying to call news agencies to claim responsibility for anything newsworthy carried out by a man with a beard (even though this one doesn\u2019t seem to have a beard, which is annoyingly inconvenient for my theory). Just so long as it\u2019s not that fat one in the red and white tunic. That\u2019s going too far. And besides, he\u2019s my man.\n\nHappy Christmas!",

    "title": "One of World's Most Dangerous Supervolcanoes Is Rumbling",
    "text": "A long-quiet yet huge supervolcano that lies under 500,000 people in Italy may be waking up and approaching a \"critical state,\" scientists report this week in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nBased on physical measurements and computer modeling, \"we propose that magma could be approaching the CDP [critical degassing pressure] at Campi Flegrei, a volcano in the metropolitan area of Naples, one of the most densely inhabited areas in the world, and where accelerating deformation and heating are currently being observed,\" wrote the scientists\u2014who are led by Giovanni Chiodini of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics in Rome.\n\nA sudden release of hot magmatic gasses is possible in the near future, which could trigger a large eruption, the scientists warn. Yet the timing of any possible eruption is unknown and is currently not possible to predict.\n\nIn response to the news, Italy's government has raised the volcano's threat level from green to yellow, or from quiet to requires scientific monitoring. In other words, the government is urging a measured response to the study, followed by additional scientific work.\n\nCampi Flegrei means \"burning fields\" in Italian. Like other supervolcanoes\u2014such as the one responsible for the geothermal features of Yellowstone\u2014it is not a single volcanic cone. Rather, it's a large complex, much of it underground or under the Mediterranean Sea, that includes 24 craters, as well as various geysers and vents that can release hot gas.\n\nLiving Up Close and Personal With an Active Volcano\n\nSupervolcanoes are usually characterized by a large caldera, or depression, that formed from past explosive eruptions. Campi Flegrei's depression, just west of Naples, is more than seven miles across.\n\nCampi Flegrei is thought to have formed hundreds of thousands of years ago. A massive eruption 200,000 years ago spewed so much ash that it darkened the skies around the planet, triggering a \"volcanic winter.\" That event is thought to have been the largest volcanic episode in the history of Europe over that time.\n\nThe volcano erupted again 35,000 and 12,000 years ago. An eruption about 40,000 years ago might have contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals, a 2010 study suggested, although that report has been debated. The volcanic area was also known by the ancient Greeks. (See pictures of another supervolcano.)\n\nA smaller but still sizable eruption was observed at the supervolcano in 1538. That event lasted eight days and created the mountain Monte Nuovo. But since then, the volcano has been quiet, slumbering for more than 500 years.\n\nThe scientists caution that it's possible nothing will happen in our lifetimes. They say it's impossible to say with any certainty when an eruption might actually take place. More monitoring and study are needed, they say.\n\nVolcanoes 101\n\nThe scars of another supervolcano were recently found in the Sesia Valley in the Italian Alps. That eight-mile-wide caldera likely last erupted 280 million years ago, when it blasted out a thousand times more material than Mount St. Helens spewed during its infamous 1980 eruption. The result was the blocking out of the sun, which led to global cooling.\n\n\"There will be another supervolcano explosion,\" scientist James Quick, a geologist at Southern Methodist University in Texas, said in a statement when that volcano was found.",

But three ministers under the same grace-and-favour roof could present real difficulties unless certain protocols are observed. We\u2019ve updated the basic rules to make the ministerial house-share an experience as enriching as it is economical.\n\n1. Where possible, the three ministers should use the house on different weekends, according to the rota drawn up by the cabinet office. On those occasions when the nation\u2019s diplomatic needs require all three ministers to be in residence at the same time, the pool hours will be as follows: 9am-12pm, Liam Fox; 12pm to 3pm, Boris Johnson; 3pm to 4pm, Free swim; 4pm to closing, David Davis.\n\nBoris Johnson forced to share mansion with Liam Fox and David Davis Read more\n\n2. Label your dignitaries. It\u2019s easy to imagine the worst happening when a guest of the secretary of state for exiting the European Union is mistaken for a guest of the secretary of state for international trade: before you know it somebody accidentally agrees to the free movement of people just to flog 4,000 Mondeos. The \u201cHello, my name is\u201d badges in the basket by the east entrance aren\u2019t just there for show. We also have colour-coded bathrobes for the mornings.\n\n3. If you make your way up the main staircase to the second floor, then turn left, then right, then left again, then straight for a hundred yards or so, you will find a little storage area just across from bedroom 68. The box for the Wi-Fi is in there, and the password is on the bottom. If you have trouble connecting, sometimes unplugging the box for a few seconds helps, but please warn the others before you do it. This connection is for ministers of state only. Visiting dignitaries should use the Wi-Fi called \u201cChevening_secure123\u201d, so we can spy on them.\n\n4. If the lord privy seal has not shown you the correct procedure for using the Nespresso machine, then DO NOT USE THE NESPRESSO MACHINE. Also DO NOT LET THE FOREIGN SECRETARIES OF OTHER NATIONS USE THE NESPRESSO MACHINE, even if they claim to have one just like it at home. There are still stains on the ceiling from John Kerry\u2019s last visit.\n\n5. It\u2019s a big lake, but there\u2019s only one boat. Please leave it tied up by the little boathouse, not just floating in the middle. William Hague once spent a whole weekend chucking rocks at it to try and get it ashore.

Don\u2019t leave food in the maze. It\u2019s tempting to have a go in the maze during champagne and nibbles receptions \u2013 guests love it \u2013 but if they leave their plates behind, it attracts foxes. Do you know what happens when a drunk Japanese diplomat who can\u2019t find his way out of the maze meets three hungry foxes in the middle of the night?

The show promotes health and disease prevention.\n\nPhotograph by Thierry Grobet, Rolex\n\nFormer schoolteacher Bruktawit Tigabu is an unlikely media mogul.\n\nBut on Ethiopian TV and radio, Tigabu has become a major force in improving kids\u2019 lives.\n\nTigabu\u2019s Addis Ababa-based production company, Whiz Kids Workshop, produces children\u2019s TV shows that promote early education, literacy, health education, and gender equality. Among them: Tsehai Loves Learning, Ethiopia\u2019s first educational TV preschool program; Little Investigators, the country\u2019s first kid-oriented science show; and the recently launched animated series Tibeb Girls.\n\nTigabu, raised in poverty, had no intention of becoming something of a media magnate. But after three years as an elementary school teacher, Tigabu realized that she needed a bigger venue to address widespread illiteracy and hygiene issues, as well as the mortality rate\u2014over 300,000 Ethiopian children under the age of five die every year, most from malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, and malnutrition.\n\nView Images Tigabu and her husband, Shane Etzenhouser, record music for an episode of Tsehai Loves Learning.\n\nPhotograph by Thierry Grobet, Rolex\n\n\u201cFree education here is only offered to children once they turn seven,\u2019\u2019 says Tigabu, 35, a Rolex Laureate. \u201cVery few people can afford to send their kids to private school, so it\u2019s the vacuum of these early years that we fill.\u201d\n\nTsehai Loves Learning, which features a Sesame Street\u2013style talking giraffe puppet, began airing in 2010 and is now a national hit watched by more than five million Ethiopians. The more than hundred-episode series promotes health through songs, storytelling, and simple graphics. (The Rolex Award helped fund episodes that focused on malaria and diarrhea). Field tests ensure that viewers are absorbing the show's learning objectives.\n\nView Images Children in Sendafa, a small town north of Ethiopia's capital, screen a TV show produced by Tigabu's Whiz Kids Workshop production company.\n\nPhotograph by Thierry Grobet, Rolex\n\nWhiz Kids has since developed two additional series, Tasha's Fidel School, which promotes reading and writing skills, and Involve Me, a reality series featuring films of personal life lessons created by underprivileged youths.\n\nTibeb Girls, which launched last month, is an action-drama about three young girls who use their superpowers to fight against gender inequality, child marriage, and the educational and sexual issues facing adolescent girls.\n\nTigabu and her husband and Whiz Kids production partner, Shane Etzenhouser, are planning a 2018 TV series targeting adolescent girls.\n\n\u201cWe want to give more kids the tools to help them think better,\u2019\u2019 says Tigabu.",

    "title": "12 potential reasons you're having heart palpitations",
    "text": "If you\u2019ve ever experienced a heart palpitation, you know that the feeling of having a fast, fluttering, or pounding heart is scary, to say the least. But despite the freakiness, experts say heart palpitations happen pretty often\u2014and they\u2019re usually not dangerous or a sign of your impending doom.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very common,\u201d Malissa Wood, M.D., co-director of the Corrigan Women's Heart Health Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells SELF. \u201cMost people will have palpitations at some point in their lives, even if [the palpitations] are short-lived.\" Nicole Weinberg, M.D., a cardiologist at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, agrees, telling SELF that heart palpitations are \u201cextremely common\u201d in young women.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, heart palpitations can feel like your heart is skipping beats, fluttering, beating too fast, or pumping harder than usual. \u201cIf you feel your heart beating at all, that can be a palpitation,\u201d Wood explains. You might feel heart palpitations in your throat, neck, or chest, and they can occur when you\u2019re active or resting, and whether you\u2019re standing, sitting, or lying down, the Mayo Clinic says.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a sensation that your heart is skipping beats or beating too fast\u2014your heart is actually doing this, Weinberg says, noting that there can be several reasons for it. A major cause of heart palpitations in young women is having too much caffeine, she says. Wood agrees: \u201cThat second or third latte of the morning can bring out extra beats.\u201d\n\nStress and anxiety are also big causes of heart palpitations, Wood says. \u201cWhen your adrenaline level goes up, it makes you feel the palpitations because your heart is beating stronger or faster,\u201d she explains. Lack of sleep can also be an issue, she says, adding that \u201call of the things that make you on edge can cause palpitations.\u201d\n\nJennifer Haythe, M.D., assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, tells SELF that nicotine can also cause palpitations. \"It's a stimulant that can irritate the heart and cause extra beats,\" she explains.\n\nHormones can play a role as well. That can be from taking new hormonal birth control pills, missing a menstrual cycle, or \u201cany sort of hormonal changes,\u201d Weinberg says. Pregnancy can also cause heart palpitations because your baseline heart rate increases in order to provide for you and the baby, Haythe says. \"Even though there\u2019s nothing wrong with you, you may feel a sense of palpitations,\" she says.\n\nDietary changes can cause palpitations, too, Weinberg says, but it tends to be person-specific. \u201cI do have some patients that say whenever they eat a lot of [fill in the blank] foods, like dairy or gluten, or when they\u2019re not having their regular three meals a day\u2026those are things that can bring on palpitations,\u201d she says. Similarly, low blood sugar can give you heart palpitations, especially if you haven't been eating enough but have been working out, Haythe says.\n\nWhile Wood says heart palpitations are largely not dangerous, she points out that they can be caused by a thyroid condition, high electrolyte levels, or even heart disease in some cases. If you find that you\u2019re having heart palpitations that last for several minutes at a time, you feel like you\u2019re going to pass out when you have them, you experience them when you exercise, or you have chest pain or shortness of breath with palpitations, Wood says you need to get yourself checked out.\n\nWeinberg agrees. \u201cA few isolated palpitations are not a big deal, but if they\u2019re associated with other symptoms or coming more frequently, that\u2019s something that would be alarming,\u201d she says. If you find that you get heart palpitations here and there with no other symptoms, Haythe says it\u2019s a good idea to mention it to your doctor during your annual checkup. Your doctor may want to have you do a basic electrocardiogram, just to make sure everything is OK with your heart. \u201cTake your symptoms seriously,\" Haythe says. \"But in the majority of cases, it's nothing to worry about.\"",

    "text": "MILAN \u2014 The Tunisian man suspected of driving a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin was killed early Friday in a shootout with police in Milan, ending a Europe-wide manhunt, Italy\u2019s interior minister said.\n\nChecks conducted after the shootout showed \u201cthe person killed, without a shadow of a doubt, is Anis Amri, the suspect of the terrorist attack,\u201d Interior Minister Marco Minniti said.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Monday attack in Berlin, which killed 12 and injured 56 others.\n\nAmri, 24, who had spent time in prison in Italy, was stopped by two officers during a routine police check in the Sesto San Giovanni neighbourhood of Milan early Friday. He pulled a gun from his backpack after being asked to show his identity papers and was killed in the ensuing shootout.\n\nOne of the officers was shot and is in the hospital, but his condition is not life-threatening, Minniti said. The other officer fatally shot Amri.\n\nGerman authorities said they were still awaiting official confirmation that the person killed in Milan was Amri, but German Interior Ministry spokesman Tobias Plate said \u201cshould this turn out to be true, then the Interior Ministry is relieved that this person doesn\u2019t pose a threat anymore.\u201d\n\nBerlin suspect Amri killed near Milan (3) - Tunisian opened fire during ordinary stop-check https://t.co/lalCWL71CV \u2014 Ansa English News (@ansa_english) December 23, 2016\n\nAmri arrived in Italy via France - Took train to Turin, then went to Milan and Sesto San Giovanni https://t.co/uJM5LJZA0S \u2014 Ansa English News (@ansa_english) December 23, 2016\n\nTrainee policeman killed Amri - Luca Scat\u00e0, 29, shit dead suspected terrorist https://t.co/AOm5vtOrDC \u2014 Ansa English News (@ansa_english) December 23, 2016\n\nIt was unclear how and when Amri travelled from Berlin to Milan. German authorities issued a Europe-wide wanted notice for him on Wednesday, two days after the attack.\n\nA Milan anti-terrorism official said Amri arrived at Milan\u2019s train station early Friday and investigators are trying to figure out where he came from.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation, said Amri made his way to the piazza outside the Sesto San Giovanni train station in a suburb of Milan, which is 7.5 kilometres (4.7 miles) away from the main train station.\n\nThe official says two police officers were suspicious because it was 3 a.m. and the station was closed. Officials are still trying to determine how he arrived at the piazza. Some buses run at that hour, but no trains, trams or metros.\n\nThe official says investigators are also working to determine what contacts, if any, Amri had in Milan. There is no evidence that he ever passed through Milan during his previous stay in Italy, where he spent time after leaving Tunisia in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.\n\nHe was repeatedly transferred among Sicilian prisons for bad conduct, with prison records saying he bullied inmates and tried to spark insurrections. He served 3 1/2 years for setting a fire at a refugee centre and making threats, among other things \u2014 but Italy apparently detected no signs that he was becoming radicalized.\n\nHis mother said he went from there to Switzerland, then moved on to Germany last year.\n\nAuthorities in Germany deemed him a potential threat long before the Berlin market attack, and even kept him under covert surveillance for six months this year.\n\nThey had been trying to deport him after his asylum application was rejected in July but were unable to do so because he lacked valid identity papers and Tunisia initially denied that he was a citizen.\n\nAuthorities say Amri has used at least six different names and three nationalities in his travels around Europe.\n\nA spokeswoman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ulrike Demmer, said the German leader would speak with her Tunisian counterpart later Friday to discuss issues including the deportation of Tunisian citizens.",

    "text": "By Jacqueline Howard\n\nPHILADELPHIA (CNN) \u2014 Whether you call them gray hairs or stress highlights, world-renowned animal scientist and autism advocate Temple Grandin wants you to know that dogs may get them prematurely, too \u2014 especially when stressed, such as being left at home alone.\n\nPremature graying in dogs may be an indicator of anxiety and impulsivity, according to a study published in this month\u2019s edition of the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science, in which Grandin served as a co-author.\n\nCamille King, an animal behaviorist and owner of the Canine Education Center in Denver, noticed a few years ago that many impulsive and anxious dogs seemed to be prematurely turning gray. When King told Grandin about her observations, Grandin said she encouraged King to lead the research.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I thought of when she told me that were the presidents, and how they age and get prematurely gray,\u201d said Grandin, professor of animal science at Colorado State University, referring to American commanders in chief.\n\n\u201cThe fact that presidents turn prematurely gray was one of the things that made me encourage her to do the study,\u201d Grandin said.\n\n\u201cBasically, (the study findings) validated what she had seen in years of doing dog behavior work.\u201d\n\n\u2018I was surprised\u2019\n\nThe study, conducted at Northern Illinois University, involved 400 dogs, 4 years old or younger, with non-white-colored hair so the researchers could adequately determine degrees of graying.\n\n\u201cNormally, dogs wouldn\u2019t be gray at age 4,\u201d Grandin said.\n\nThe researchers took two photos of each dog and asked each dog\u2019s owner to complete a 21-question survey, which included questions about the dog\u2019s anxious or impulsive behaviors. Both behaviors hold clues to how stressed the dog might be, sort of like how emotional instability and anxiety are associated with stress in humans.\n\nAnxious behaviors include whether the dog whines or barks when left home alone or cringes or cowers in groups of people, and impulsivity can be seen in whether the dog jumps on people when greeting them or excessively tugs on the leash when going on walks.\n\nThe dog owners were unaware of the true purpose of the study when they completed the questionnaires.\n\nNext, the researchers compared the survey responses with how much gray hair appeared on the dogs\u2019 muzzles in their photos.\n\nGrandin helped the researchers build a scoring system to measure the degrees of grayness: A score of 0 is \u201cno gray;\u201d 1 is for gray on the front of the nose only; 2 is for gray hair halfway up the muzzle; and 3 is \u201cfull gray.\u201d\n\nIt turned out that a high grayness score was significantly and positively predicted by survey responses that indicated both high anxiety and impulsivity.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the results indicate that for each standard deviation increase in the measured trait, either anxiety or impulsiveness, the odds of being in a higher rating category of muzzle grayness increase 40% to 65%,\u201d said Thomas Smith, a professor at Northern Illinois University\u2019s Department of Educational Technology, Research and Assessment, who was a co-author of the study.\n\nSmith added that he was initially skeptical that a dog\u2019s premature muzzle grayness might be linked to anxiety and impulsiveness.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we analyzed the data, the results actually were striking,\u201d he said. \u201cI was surprised.\u201d\n\nA similar association between stress and premature graying possibly could be found in other mammals, outside of humans and dogs, but more research is needed, Grandin said.\n\nIs Fido more like us than we thought?\n\nThe new study appears to extend what has been previously seen in people \u2014 the relationship between stress and gray hair \u2014 to dogs, said Matt Kaeberlein, a professor and co-director of the University of Washington\u2019s Dog Aging Project, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cThere are a few things about this study that I really like. One is that it nicely illustrates another way in which dogs and humans are similar, specifically in this case, the way we interact with our environment to experience stress. I like the innovative approach of applying facial image recognition to dogs,\u201d Kaeberlein said.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that while hair graying is a useful \u2018biomarker\u2019 of aging and experienced stress, it is not particularly precise. We should avoid interpreting causation from correlation,\u201d he said about the study. \u201cMany dogs and people get gray hair for reasons unrelated to their perception of stress or anxiety, so while anxiety (or) stress appears to cause hair graying, gray hair is not necessarily caused by anxiety or stress. In other words, just because your dog gets gray hair doesn\u2019t mean she or he is stressed out.\u201d\n\nFor instance, more research is needed to determine how much genetics might play a role not only in premature graying in young dogs but also how a dog might respond to stress, Grandin said. She added that additional research could also determine how much of the study results were influenced by anxiety and impulsivity, respectively.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably some genetic influence where some dogs that are impulsive and anxious don\u2019t turn gray. You see, that would be your genetic interaction, but when you take a big population of dogs, it statistically comes out that anxious and impulsive dogs are more likely to start turning gray before age 4,\u201d Grandin said.\n\n\u201cGenetic factors are important, but genetic factors also can be modified by experience, so you can\u2019t just say an animal\u2019s hard-wired genetics, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s both. Both genetics and the environment are important,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat to do if your dog is stressed\n\nIf pet owners notice that their dog is prematurely graying, they should make an appointment with their veterinarian or an applied animal behaviorist, said King, the lead author of the study.\n\n\u201cA medical workup could be completed along with a screening for anxiety or stress,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cOnce a dog is screened, and if found to be anxious or impulsive, there are many treatment options, such as behavior modification programming, medication, alternative techniques such as a pressure wrap,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is very important to have the dog professionally examined to get to the root of the problem, and not assume that because the dog is prematurely gray, it is related to stress.\u201d\n\nIf the dog is stressed, what might be a common cause? Being left home alone, Grandin said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very concerned about all these dogs spending so much time home alone all day. I walk through the streets where I live at 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon and I can hear dogs barking and whining in houses,\u201d Grandin said.\n\n\u201cWe have bred dogs to be social beings, and then you leave them home all day and they don\u2019t get to do much socializing,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the home alone problem is a big factor. This is just my opinion.\u201d\n\nGrandin said one of her colleagues tends to leave his dogs with a friend when he is away from home, and she encourages others to do the same.\n\n\u201cSome people take their dogs to doggy day care. Some of those are good. Some of them are run poorly,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have a dog that does not handle being home alone well, maybe you need to be making arrangements to drop him off at the next door neighbor\u2019s on your way to work.\u201d\n\nThe-CNN-Wire \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

    "text": "Dear Amy: For many years, my 92-year-old father and I have been bitterly disagreeing about his climbing on ladders and high step stools to change light bulbs.\n\nHis balance is poor, and I've seen him almost fall many times.\n\nLast week he fell backward at a restaurant, hit his head and had to go to the ER for stitches.\n\nTwo days later I saw him walk down the hall with a tall step stool to check the fire alarm, which I ended up climbing up and checking for him.\n\nMonths ago my husband saw my father about to get on a tall step stool to change a light fixture outside and suggested we have our contractor do it, but my father wouldn't listen, so my father had my husband, who is prone to seizures, climb up to fix the light fixture -- putting my husband's life in danger.\n\nI was furious. His neighbour was so concerned about his getting on ladders she said that if she ever saw him on one, she would call the police.\n\nHe is so stubborn. How would you suggest I get him to stop this extremely dangerous endeavor? I am so angry and I don't want him to die.\n\n-- Angry in Sausalito\n\nDear Angry: Here's what you need to know, and this is a certainty: Your father is going to die. You don't want him to, but he will. To some extent, he is choosing how things will go -- by stubbornly maintaining his independent wish to do as he pleases, regardless of the danger and likely consequences.\n\nYou have fought this bitter battle with him for years. You could try to convince him to make a list of household chores so that during your visits you can perform some of these tasks, but he doesn't sound likely to comply.\n\nIt's important for you to realize that your father could trip on a rug in the kitchen, injure himself bathing, or in countless other ways.\n\nUnless you would like to move in with him to try to protect him from his own impulses, I think you should try to let this go.\n\nDear Amy: I am a 26-year-old woman from Hong Kong living in London. I met this guy through a dating app. We were very compatible in every way. I was recovering from a fling. He left a six-year relationship just after they became engaged.\n\nWe almost got to the point where we hung out like a couple, knowing each other's friends and family. I asked him where this relationship was heading. (I know I shouldn't have, but I couldn't help it.)\n\nHe replied that he really liked me. He was about to go to Burma for a short trip, so he said he would give me an answer after the trip. After the trip, he told me he is likely moving there to start a business with his friend. He said he doesn't want a relationship with anyone right now.\n\nI believe him, but it's still upsetting, I have never been with a guy who I can see a future with. However, I also saw a lot of red flags. He didn't pay for the first date. Since the third or fourth dates, I always initiated getting together.\n\nI want to make him realize how uniquely compatible we are. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n-- J\n\nDear J: I wish I had suggestions on ways to prove that you are compatible with this guy, but you're not compatible with this guy.\n\nHe is not that into you. If he was, he would be demonstrating his interest in exactly the same ways you are demonstrating yours: initiating getting together, for instance, and by not making plans to move to another country.\n\nYou have done nothing wrong -- you are simply at different points in your lives. I think it is great that you have had the experience of being with someone where you are feeling these wonderful feelings and where you realize that you want to have a relationship. Consider this realization his gift to you. Accept this gift, and move on.\n\nDear Amy: I was shocked when you told \"Heartbroken\" that his wife's choice to work out at the gym every day indicated that their marriage was in trouble. Maybe this woman just wants to get healthy!\n\n-- Fit Wife\n\nDear Fit: Along with other changes in this woman's life, sudden frequent gym attendance and losing weight are indicators that the marriage might be in trouble.",

    "title": "USAfrica: Buhari\u2019s policies, actions fuel latest agitation for Biafra. By Femi Aribisala",
    "text": "Buhari\u2019s policies, actions fuel latest agitation for Biafra.\n\nBy Femi Aribisala\n\nSpecial to USAfrica multimedia networks (Houston) and USAfricaonline.com @USAfricaLive\n\nIn the eight years of Obasanjo\u2019s presidency (1999-2007), there was no headline-grabbing demand for Biafra. Ditto for the eight years of the Yar\u2019adua/Jonathan presidency. However, within months of Buhari\u2019s presidency, the Igbo demand for Biafra has become deafening. Without a doubt, the blame for this new impetus must be laid firmly at the doorstep of President Buhari. Moreover, rather than attenuate it, the president and the APC have exacerbated separatist tendencies in the country.\n\nThis was part of the reason why people like me did not support Buhari\u2019s election as president of Nigeria. I have written severally in Vanguard that Nigeria must remain a united nation. In my column of 4th March, 2014 entitled: \u201cRe-inventing Igbo Politics in Nigeria,\u201d I maintained that: \u201cNigeria cannot survive without the Igbo.\u201d The following week on 11th March 2014, I wrote another article entitled: \u201cNigeria Cannot Do without the North.\u201d\n\nI remain persuaded by both positions. But if Nigeria is indeed to remain united, there are certain things that must be said and done. The problem with the Buhari administration is that it seems totally impervious to these imperatives.\n\nSecond-class treatment\n\nThere is no question that, as one of the major ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Igbo have been hard done by. Since the civil war 45 years ago, they have been treated as if they were a minority ethnic group in Nigeria when in fact they are one of the majorities. No Igbo has been considered worthy of being head-of-state. The South East of Ndigbo is the only one of the six geopolitical zones of the country with five states. All other zones have six or more.\n\nIndeed, the number of local governments in the North-East is virtually double that of the South-East. As a result, the Ndigbo receive the smallest amount of revenue allocation among all the zones, in spite of the fact that some of the South-eastern states are among the oil-producing states.\n\nThe roads in the South-east are notoriously bad. Government after government have simply ignored them. Inconsequential ministerial positions are usually zone to Ndigbo. Time was when it seemed the lackluster Ministry of Information was their menial preserve. It is also a known fact that every so often the Igbo are slaughtered in the North under one guise or the other. Many are forced to abandon their homes and businesses and run for dear life. The people who perpetrate these acts never seem to be arrested or prosecuted.\n\nWhen a major tribe is treated procedurally as second-class in their own country, there will be a demand for self-determination sooner rather than later. When a group of people feel unsafe in their own country, they cannot but be expected to decide to opt out. It is not the responsibility of the government to imprison the Igbo in Nigeria. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure and guarantee that they feel safe and are treated with respect.\n\nDiscrimination against the South\n\nWhile these issues have been brewing under the surface for some time, the lop-sided tendencies of President Buhari have brought them all out to boiling-point. In his first-coming as head-of-state in 1984, Buhari antagonized Ndigbo by locking up Vice-President Alex Ekwueme, an Igbo man, in jail in Kirikiri; while President Shehu Shagari, a Fulani man was only placed under house arrest. In addition, Buhari arrested and jailed Ojukwu, another Igbo icon for no just cause.\n\nAs Chairman of the Petroleum Trust Fund, Buhari discriminated blatantly against the South and especially the South-east. For example, his PTF built only 4,440 kilometres of roads in Southern Nigeria representing a paltry 24%; while 13,870 kilometres were built in the North representing 76%. Of these figures, the Southeast and South-south combined only received 13.5%.\n\nUnder the PTF\u2019s National Health and Rehabilitation Program (NHERP), the entire South got 0% allocation, while the North got 100% in the tertiary program. In the vocational program, the entire South had only 3% while the North had 97%. The same was for the primary side where the South had only 12% but the north was allocated 88%. The secondary area was no different. While the North had 86% percent, the South had just 14%.\n\nDisenfranchisement of Ndigbo\n\nThese anomalies have been duplicated to date in the seven months of Buhari\u2019s presidency. In the first place, Buhari won virtually without Igbo votes. In order to diminish Jonathan\u2019s votes, a major assault was made against them; recognising that they are some of the staunchest Jonathan supporters. INEC ensured that, far more disproportionately relative to other geopolitical zones, millions of South-East voters disappeared between 2011 and 2015.\n\nOnly 7.6 million voters were registered for the 2015 election in the South-east, and only 5.6 million PVCs collected. Compare this with Buhari\u2019s North-west, there were 17.6 million registrations and 15.1 million collections. While in the South-west, there were 4.2 million votes in 2015, relative to 4.6 million in 2011: in the South-east, there were only 2.6 million votes in 2015, relative to 5 million in 2011; a drastic drop of 2.4 million.\n\nWhile Kano, Katsina, Kaduna, Jigawa and Bauchi posted their traditional humongous figures; Imo, Anambra and Abia posted relatively disappointing figures. While the internally displaced Northerners in the North-East could vote; internally displaced Igbos from the North could not. While the card-readers failed in many parts of the South-east, suggestive they were programmed to fail; they worked in most parts of the North. In places like Lagos and Kano, many non-indigenes, including the Igbo, were not even given their PVCs.\n\nMaking of a hero\n\nPresident Buhari then added insult to injury by stating on his visit to the United States that he could not be expected to treat those who voted for him in the same way as those who did not.\n\nHe said: \u201c(Going by election results), constituencies that gave me 97% cannot in all honesty be treated, on some issues, with constituencies that gave me 5%. I think these are political realities. While, certainly there will be justice for everybody but the people who voted, and made their votes count, they must feel the government has appreciated the effort they put in putting the government in place.\u201d\n\nWhile his media assistants later tried to water down this disturbing statement, the reality was that, apart from the constitutionally-stipulated requirement that every state must be represented in the presidential Cabinet, Buhari has virtually ignored the Igbo in his appointments.\n\nTwo moves showed the level of insensitivity of the Buhari administration to these anomalies. The first was the decision to move Boko Haram prisoners down from the North to the South-east; a move firmly resisted by the Igbo as it would have made them a target of suicide-bombers. The other was the blunder of placing Nnamdi Kanu, the director of Radio Biafra, under arrest; charging him with treason and terrorism.\n\nAll the government has achieved by this is inflame passions in the South-east. It has also made a hero out of Kanu. Those who did not know about Kanu before now know him. Those who were not disposed to Biafra before are now shouting Biafra. For weeks on end, Biafra has become the biggest news item nationwide, with agitations, demonstrations, threats and arrests.\n\nAgenda for action\n\nThe government needs to apply more wisdom here. At the moment, it has become the biggest promoter of Biafra by the way it has gone about things. The idea of Biafra cannot be killed with a sledge hammer, if at all. What is required is to address the root causes that impelled Biafra. Unfortunately, it would appear the Buhari administration is unwilling to do this.\n\nAs a matter of urgency, Nnamdi Kanu must be released unconditionally. If the government persists in labeling him a terrorist, his supporters might decide to become terrorists. Nigeria already has enough problem of Boko Haram conflagration in the North-east. We cannot afford to light another fire in the South-east.\n\nKanu was living in England. If he were a terrorist, he would have been arrested there. The fact that he lived there without constraints or restraints shows he was not considered a threat, either to Britain or to Nigeria.\n\nIt is not a crime to fight for self-determination; it is a right. The government must not give the impression that Nigeria is a prison where we must all live, irrespective of the living conditions. The government needs to address the grievances of the Igbo. Their roads and bridges must be built. Their waterways must be opened up to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nEastern sea-ports must be developed. Railways must link their mercantile cities to the North. Their coal resources must be profitably exploited for the benefit of their unemployed youth and citizenry. An additional state must be created in the South-east to bring it up to par with other geopolitical zones.\n\nNational question\n\nMoreover, we need to revisit again a critical issue addressed during the truncated National Conference: the issue of resource allocation. This is a major gripe of the Igbo and it is a legitimate gripe. It is not in the interest of Nigeria to continue in this age-old practice where all the states gather every month in Abuja for handouts, whether they are productive or not. This gives the wrong impression that some states are insisting on being piggy-backed by others. We need to develop a system that rewards and encourages productivity.\n\nThose who produce should be allowed to keep disproportionately what they produce, instead of the current situation where they are required to share it disproportionately with those relatively less productive. The truth of the matter is that every part of Nigeria is resource rich. Every part of Nigeria has the requisite manpower. Unfortunately, our current over-concentration on oil militates against the development of other indigenous resources.\n\nA situation where national resources are distributed according to the number of local government councils, and where there is now supposedly only 96 local government councils in the South-East, relative to 186 in the North-west does not suggest equity and justice.\n\nThe disgruntlement in the South-east about the Nigeria project will not disappear by ignoring it. It will not disappear by arresting Kanu. It will not disappear by issuing threats. Neither will it disappear by denying the youth of the South-east their freedom of speech and assembly.\n\nToday, the demand for Biafra remains the demand of a minority of the Igbo. If the root causes of their anger are not addressed, the minority will soon become the majority. If that happens, Nigeria might unravel. I repeat what I have stated before: the Nigeria of our manifest destiny cannot be realized without the Igbo.",

    "title": "Why NASA's First Good Look at Mars Almost Ended Its Exploration",
    "text": "View Images The Mariner 4 spacecraft\u2014which launched on November 28, 1964\u2014passed within 6,118 miles of Mars on July 14, 1965, sending us back the first close-up photos of the red planet.\n\nPhotograph by NASA, Associated Press\n\nIf Cyber Monday doesn\u2019t bring you holiday cheer, then you have another option: November 28 is also Red Planet Day, which commemorates the 1964 launch of the Mariner 4 spacecraft to Mars.\n\nThe images sent back to Earth as the probe flew by Mars eight months later provided our first detailed glimpse of the surface of an alien planet. And the data collected by Mariner 4 provided key information about how to safely deliver future missions to the Martian surface.\n\nBut, in the short-term, Mariner 4 was a PR disaster for NASA. The grainy, black-and-white images revealed a barren planet pockmarked with craters. It looked no different than the moon.\n\nNobody had seriously expected images of lush vegetation growing along the banks of water-filled canals. But Mars had captivated the public imagination for centuries. The bleak Mariner 4 images could only disappoint.\n\n\u201cMars, it now appears, is a desolate world,\u201d declared a July 30, New York Times editorial titled \u201cDead Planet.\u201d \u201cIts surface bathed in deadly radiation from outer space, it has very little atmosphere and has probably never had large bodies of water such as those in which life developed on this planet.\u201d\n\nThanks to exploration made possible by the Mariner 4 spacecraft, we now know that Mars, the red planet, may not have always been so red. In fact, 3.5 billion years ago it had an ocean that spanned its entire northern hemisphere! Join astrobiologist and National Geographic Emerging Explorer Brendan Mullan on a trip back to when the solar system first began, and find out why Mars\u2019s ocean disappeared\u2014and how Earth escaped that same fate.\n\nThe Times added that these findings refuted a draft report\u2014published three months earlier by the National Academy of Sciences\u2014which had stated, \u201cGiven all the evidence presently available, we believe it entirely reasonable that Mars is inhabited with living organisms and that life independently originated there.\"\n\nOthers piled on, including skeptics within the scientific community. Physicist Philip Abelson said that Mariner 4 provided evidence that it is \u201cunlikely that organic chemicals are being formed on Mars or have been synthesized there in the past.\u201d Even President Lyndon B. Johnson weighed in, saying that \u201clife as we know it with its humanity is more unique than many have thought.\u201d\n\nBut for scientists who endorsed the exploration of Mars, the Mariner 4 had been a tremendous success\u2014and they bristled at the premature conclusions drawn from the initial images of the red planet.\n\nAlthough the National Academy of Sciences had said it was reasonable for Mars to host living organisms, it also cautioned that those life-forms would almost certainly be microbes, which would be impossible to detect without landing on the surface.\n\nAnd, as the NASA History Office explains, \u201cThe spacecraft had, after all, imaged only 1 percent of Mars at resolution so low that, had it photographed Earth, scientists examining its pictures would likely have missed all signs of terrestrial life.\u201d\n\nStill, NASA had been selling the public on the idea that exploring Mars promised the possibility of finding the first evidence of extraterrestrial life. The initial, bleak images of the red planet made that a harder sell. In 1967, the U.S. Congress\u2014already frustrated by the escalating costs of the Apollo program and the Vietnam War\u2014cut $30 million from the program to land a spacecraft on Mars.\n\nThe cuts, though, didn\u2019t end the program. Other Mariner spacecraft would be sent to Mars over the next few years. And, in 1976, NASA finally landed the Viking spacecraft on the red planet\u2019s surface. But, the apparent failure of the lander to detect even microbes was another deep blow to public enthusiasm for exploring the red planet.\n\n\u201cSince Mars offered by far the most promising habitat for extraterrestrial life in the solar system, it is now virtually certain that the Earth is the only life-bearing planet in our region of the galaxy,\u201d said Norman Horowitz, one of Viking\u2019s principal scientists. \u201cWe have awakened from a dream.\u201d\n\nView Images Mars had captivated the public imagination for centuries. The bleak Mariner 4 images\u2014showing a barren planet pockmarked with craters\u2014could only disappoint.\n\nPhotograph by NASA\n\nBut the search for life on Mars and other worlds would regain its place in the public\u2019s imagination 20 years later. On August 7, 1996, NASA geologists held a press conference to announce the discovery of microscopic fossils in a meteorite that had originated from Mars. The widely published electron microscopic imagery of the meteorite revealed wormlike shapes that looked organic, even if scientists later concluded otherwise.\n\nAnd, a week after the Mars meteorite press conference, NASA released stunning new images of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa taken by the Galileo spacecraft, indicating that liquid water existed beneath its cracked icy crust.\n\nIt was a testament to the power of imagery. Three decades earlier, the dull black-and-white images taken by the Mariner 4 spacecraft had prompted the New York Times to write off Mars as a \u201cdead planet.\u201d Now, high-resolution images of Europa and the Mars meteorite offered the tantalizing prospect of finding life on other worlds\u2014prompting media outlets such as the New York Times to announce that the U.S. was on the verge of \u201cA Revived Hunt for Otherworldly Organisms.\u201d\n\nAnd it was all made possible by the initial success of the Mariner 4.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Stunning New Photos of Isolated Tribe Yield Surprises",
    "text": "Aerial photographs of an isolated tribe in the Brazilian rain forest are yielding a sensational new look at a Neolithic way of life that has all but disappeared from the face of the Earth.\n\nThe high-resolution images, taken from a helicopter last week by Brazilian photographer Ricardo Stuckert, offer an unprecedented glimpse of a vibrant indigenous community living in complete isolation in the depths of the Amazon jungle. National Geographic obtained first-time rights from Stuckert to publish a selection.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was a painter in the last century,\u201d Stuckert said, describing his reaction to seeing the natives. \u201cTo think that in the 21st century, there are still people who have no contact with civilization, living like their ancestors did 20,000 years ago\u2014it\u2019s a powerful emotion.\u201d\n\nStuckert\u2019s close-up photographs taken near Brazil\u2019s border with Peru show details about these Indians that had previously escaped the notice of experts, such as their use of elaborate body paint and the way they cut their hair. \u201cWe thought they all cut their hair in the same way,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Carlos Meirelles, who has worked with and studied Brazil\u2019s indigenous tribes for more than 40 years. \u201cNot true. You can see they have many different styles. Some look very punk.\u201d\n\nThe same tribe gained global attention in 2008, when agents from Brazil\u2019s indigenous affairs agency, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio\u2014known by its acronym, FUNAI\u2014released photographs of tribesmen in red body paint launching arrows at their low-flying airplane. (Learn about how uncontacted tribes emerge.)\n\nThe tribe has moved a number of times since that sighting, said Meirelles, a veteran FUNAI scout and expert on the region\u2019s indigenous groups. Meirelles was on last Sunday\u2019s flight, as well as previous missions in 2008 and 2010 that also yielded extraordinary images. \u201cThese groups change locations every four years or so,\u201d Meirelles told National Geographic by phone from his home. \u201cThey move around. But it\u2019s the same group.\u201d\n\nStuckert arrived earlier this month in the far western Amazonian state of Acre as part of a yearlong project to photograph indigenous tribes across Brazil. Last Sunday, he boarded a helicopter with Meirelles to visit the jungle outpost of Jord\u00e3o near the border of Peru. When thunderstorms forced the chopper to make a detour in midflight, the occupants suddenly found themselves flying directly over an isolated settlement of thatched huts carved into the dense jungle. The naked inhabitants were evidently just as surprised, scattering into the surrounding forest at the aircraft\u2019s approach.\n\nThe tribe\u2019s initial panic seemed to give way to curiosity by the time the team returned a few hours later for another look. \u201cThey seemed more inquisitive than fearful,\u201d Stuckert told National Geographic when reached by phone. \u201cI felt there was a mutual curiosity, on their part and mine.\u201d\n\nThe tribe\u2019s apparent well-being was heartening to Meirelles. The people looked well fed and healthy, he said. Plots of corn, manioc, and bananas surrounding the cluster of communal huts\u2014known as a maloca\u2014seemed capable of sustaining as many as 80 to a hundred people. Together with other nearby malocas of the same tribe, Meirelles believes the population exceeds 300.\n\nEqually impressive for Meirelles was the barrage of arrows the tribesmen fired at the helicopter, which he took as a healthy sign of resistance. \u201cThey\u2019re messages,\u201d he said. \u201cThose arrows mean 'Leave us in peace. Do not disturb.'\u201d\n\nUnlike other regions of the Brazilian Amazon, the state of Acre enforces strict vigilance over its forests and indigenous inhabitants. The isolated tribes of Acre appear to be safe\u2014for now. But the jungles across the border in Peru are rife with illegal logging crews, gold prospectors, and drug traffickers, posing the kind of threats that have wiped out entire tribes in the past.\n\n\u201cOnce their territory is encroached by loggers or prospectors, the isolated groups are finished,\u201d Meirelles said. \u201cThey could disappear from the face of the Earth, and we wouldn\u2019t even know it.\u201d (See the photos of an uncontacted tribe that stirred an uproar.)\n\nAlthough they seek to avoid direct contact with outsiders, the Indians at the headwaters of the Envira and Humait\u00e1 rivers have long made use of steel tools. \u201cDating back to 1910, there have been reports that they raided settlements and made off with machetes and axes,\u201d Meirelles said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been using them for a long time. They\u2019re practically part of their culture.\u201d The tools have allowed them to clear large enough swaths of forest to expand food production. Since the group has never sustained peaceful contact with the outside world, the name of the tribe is unknown. Brazilian officials simply refer to them as the \u201cisolated Indians of the upper Humait\u00e1.\u201d\n\nA former staff photographer for major Brazilian media, including Veja and O Globo, Stuckert said his four children are his most important audience. \u201cThey\u2019re very curious, always asking questions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very interested in how these Indians live, these people who were the very first human inhabitants of our country. They want to know every detail.\u201d\n\nStuckert hopes his forthcoming book, \u00cdndios Brasileiros, will awaken the curiosity and conscience of successive generations, so that they might also experience the spine-tingling sensation he felt as he beheld the village from his perch in the helicopter.",

Misra, an internal and sports-medicine physician and medical director at U.S. Health Works, offered a few suggestions for staying healthy and stress-free during the holidays. First, get your sleep, Misra said, because no amount of holiday chores or events are worth losing sleep over. Misra warned that the lack of rest eventually has an effect on your body. \"Be it headaches, be it being just slower, having a shorter temper,\" he said, \"people should be able to cue in on the signs that we know about ourselves.\"\n\n\n\nMisra added that people also are indoors and in close quarters, so germs spread quickly. He recommended washing hands frequently and trying not to spend too much time in crowded places. He said it's the time of year when we eat more than we should, and that can add to the problems. To keep energy up, he recommended eating balanced meals and healthy snacks, rather than relying on caffeine, fast food and holiday sugar fixes. \"Yes, what people do is, they'll 'stress-eat' - they'll eat poorly in response to stress,\" he said. \"If you're putting bad fuel in, you're going to make this a lot worse.\"\n\n\n\nEven though the weather is cold, exercise is key. Misra said taking a brisk walk outdoors or squeezing in a visit to the gym will help work off some of the stress associated with holidays. (JK/Public News Service)",

German authorities issued a Europe-wide wanted notice for him on Wednesday, two days after the attack.\n\nA Milan anti-terrorism official said Amri arrived at Milan\u2019s train station early Friday and investigators are trying to figure out where he came from.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation, said Amri made his way to the piazza outside the Sesto San Giovanni train station in a suburb of Milan, which is 7.5 kilometres (4.7 miles) away from the main train station.\n\nThe official says two police officers were suspicious because it was 3 a.m. and the station was closed. Officials are still trying to determine how he arrived at the piazza. Some buses run at that hour, but no trains, trams or metros.\n\nThe official says investigators are also working to determine what contacts, if any, Amri had in Milan. There is no evidence that he ever passed through Milan during his previous stay in Italy, where he spent time after leaving Tunisia in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.\n\nHe was repeatedly transferred among Sicilian prisons for bad conduct, with prison records saying he bullied inmates and tried to spark insurrections. He served 3 1/2 years for setting a fire at a refugee centre and making threats, among other things \u2014 but Italy apparently detected no signs that he was becoming radicalized.\n\nHis mother said he went from there to Switzerland, then moved on to Germany last year.\n\nAuthorities in Germany deemed him a potential threat long before the Berlin market attack, and even kept him under covert surveillance for six months this year.\n\nThey had been trying to deport him after his asylum application was rejected in July but were unable to do so because he lacked valid identity papers and Tunisia initially denied that he was a citizen.\n\nAuthorities say Amri has used at least six different names and three nationalities in his travels around Europe.\n\nA spokeswoman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ulrike Demmer, said the German leader would speak with her Tunisian counterpart later Friday to discuss issues including the deportation of Tunisian citizens.",

    "text": "CONCESSION SPEECH OF PRESIDENT JOHN MAHAMA\n\nSpecial to USAfrica (Houston) and USAfricaonline.com @USAfricaLive\n\nMy fellow Ghanaians,\n\nMy Brothers and Sisters,\n\nA while ago, I phoned Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and offered him my congratulations for emerging the winner of the 2016 Presidential Elections.\n\nEvery election is a hard-fought battle, and this one was no exception. For those of us who choose to be contenders and go into electoral contests, we go about it as a win-lose proposition.\n\nWe believe that only one person can emerge as the winner. And while it is true that only one person can be elected President, in reality, and certainly in a democracy such as ours, every election is an opportunity for the people of this nation to express their will, to have their say in who will lead them in the shaping of Ghana\u2019s future.\n\nIn this way, each victory belongs to the people. And the true winner is always Ghana.\n\nIt is precisely on account of my belief in Ghana and its future that notwithstanding the irregularities associated with this election, I have decided at this stage to congratulate the President-elect.\n\nWith this understanding, I would like to assure the people of Ghana of my commitment to the sustenance of our country\u2019s democracy and would work to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition to the incoming administration.\n\nI remain committed to the unity and stability of our great nation.\n\nI am profoundly grateful to the almighty God and the people of Ghana for the opportunity to serve in the high office of President.\n\nAs President, I have done my bit and made a contribution to the political, social and economic development of our country. I would have cherished an opportunity to do even more, but I respect the will of the Ghanaian people.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to the individuals who have made this journey with me.\n\nI wish to thank all of the people who worked on my campaign for their dedication and tireless efforts.\n\nI wish to thank the leadership of the NDC, all of our members, foot soldiers and sympathizers for their belief in the principles of social democracy and their commitment to the vision.\n\nLikewise, I would like to thank the members of my administration for their diligent service and for bringing to fruition many of the plans we set out to accomplish\u2014the numerous programs that have been implemented and the infrastructural projects that have been completed and ongoing.\n\nI wish to thank my able Vice President Kwesi Amissah Arthur for his unflinching support and loyalty during our period in office.\n\nTo the service commanders and men and women in uniform, I wish to extend my profound gratitude to you for your selfless service to Ghana.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed working with you to ensure the internal and external security of our country.\n\nI am very proud of you.\n\nTo organised labour, the civil and public services, traditional rulers, the clergy, workers, youth groups and all identifiable bodies, I am immensely appreciative of your contributions to the development of our country in the last four years.\n\nI wish to thank my family: my children, my brothers, and sisters, and especially my wife, Lordina, for standing as firmly with me through the times of challenge and difficulty as they have through the times of achievement and promise.\n\nMost importantly, I am grateful to the almighty God who has sustained us through the implementation of the Agenda for Transformation. I am eternally grateful.\n\nGhana, this land that we all call home, is a powerful nation with a history of taking the improbable and making it possible.\n\nWe have been a leader on so many fronts, not just on this continent but also in the world\u2013from our attainment of independence, to our development of a democracy that maintains at its core a pledge of stability and a respect for the rule of law, to our formation of much-needed peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions for other nations in need.\n\nAnd we have been able to do all of these things because we have always functioned as one nation, one people.\n\nNotwithstanding our diversity, religious faiths, ethnic groups and political affiliations, we have always recognized that we are all, ultimately, on the same side\u2014the side of Ghana and its progress.\n\nWe see all throughout the world in countries that are much older than ours the devastation that division and intolerance bring.\n\nSo I pray that as we move forward, even as we voice our differences and possibly even disagree on agendas and decisions and other details of governance, we always keep in mind the fact of our shared destiny and the undeniable possibilities of power that exist in our unity.\n\nIt has been, without a doubt, one of the most tremendous privileges of my life to serve this great nation as President and to work on behalf of all Ghanaians.\n\nI will leave it to history to be the judge of my time and contributions while in that highest office.\n\nTo all of the people who cheered us on, who gathered at rallies to show their support, and who queued in long lines to vote for me, I know that this is not the outcome that we wanted and hoped for, but I say to you that this day should not mark the defeat of your role in this nation\u2019s political process.\n\nWe must do our part to ensure that the progress of all our past governments, from the very first one led by our nation\u2019s founder, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah to this most recent one that I have led, continues\u2014because progress does not happen all at once; it takes time and dedication.\n\nIn the words of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, \u201cForward ever, backward never.\u201d\n\nAt this point let me commend the electoral Commission for living up to its constitutional duty in successfully conducting the 2016 elections. My thanks also goes to the media and all stakeholders for their role in the election.\n\nAgain, allow me to offer my sincere congratulations to the President-elect, Nana Akufo-Addo.\n\nI thank you for your kind attention.\n\nMay God bless you all, and may God continue to bless our homeland Ghana.",

    "title": "USAfrica: On achievements, Obiano outperforming his predecessors.",
    "text": "By Chuks Iloegbunam\n\nSpecial to USAfrica multimedia networks (Houston) and USAfricaonline.com @USAfricaLive\n\nIn the run-up to the 2017 governorship election in Anambra State of Nigeria, Governor Willie Obiano is countless strides ahead of the most determined of his opponents. Many reasons account for this.\n\nForemost is that he firmly has the advantage of incumbency on his side. But this needs spelling out. The incumbency factor at play here is not merely the occupation of the seat of power; it is that the Anambra State Governor has more than delivered. He has surpassed the records of his predecessors.\n\nSince empiricism is in ascent, readers are called to take notice of the following facts. Governor Chris Ngige was in office for about three years, when the courts gave him the matching orders. Governor Peter Obi was through with the third year of his first term when he published a magazine entitled\n\nThree Years of Solid Accomplishments. Whoever reads the publication and also reviews Dr. Ngige\u2019s achievements, will come to an inevitable conclusion \u2013 if they compared them to the astounding performance of Governor Willie Obiano.\n\nSuch a reviewer would acknowledge that, in terms of achievements, Governor Obiano stands head and shoulders above his predecessors. But, there is need for clarity here. Many politicians and soldiers have governed Anambra State since its creation 25 years ago. Some lasted a few months and got redeployed, or sacked by military putsch. But political stability of sorts became apparent from the inception of the Fourth Republic. Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju served a single, four-year term. Dr. Ngige\u2019s tenure lasted three years. Peter Obi spent eight years, minus the three months that the distinguished Dame Virgy Etiaba ably governed, following Mr. Obi\u2019s unjust and ultimately reversed impeachment by legislative hirelings intoxicated by intrigue.\n\nObiano is close to completing his third year. The trio of Ngige, Obi and Obiano has imbued Anambra with a legacy of performance to be proud of. It was Ngige who first demonstrated to Ndi Anambra that human beings drove on tarred roads instead of through ponds and potholes. Peter Obi continued the road construction legacy, topping it with the Odo Bridge in Awgbu, which, in 2010, was the longest bridge in Anambra State.\n\nWell, Governor Obiano since upped the ante. In less than two years his government constructed the new, longest bridge in the state, the Anambra River Bridge, with a span of 280 metres. Besides, Governor Obiano has changed Awka\u2019s skyline with three magnificent flyovers on the Onitsha-Enugu expressway that splits the state capital in two. Apart from the aesthetic value of the flyovers, they have removed the tedium of travelling through Awka. Obiano has transformed Awka from a provincial enclave to a state capital worth the name.\n\nIn a dozen years, therefore, Anambra State has gone through the positive, comparative and superlative stages of good, better, best. Governor Obiano\u2019s administration is the superlative bit. This calls for people to remember the saying that, You can\u2019t change a winning team. Americans have a different way of putting it: \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d It elicits joy that, in less than three years, Governor Obiano has amply demonstrated that he empathizes with the people fate dealt him the card to govern.\n\nHe is paying salaries and pensions promptly. And these are salaries and pensions that he raised across the board by 15 percentage points! From having the lowest paid civil servants and political appointees, Anambra State under Obiano now boasts a pay structure that compares favourably with the best in Nigeria, notwithstanding that 5000 employees were introduced into the state\u2019s workforce on the eve of his inauguration, and not minding the financial adversity occasioned by the current recession. Governor Obiano has opened up the state\u2019s agricultural sector to a spectacular explosion.\n\nThose who previously pooh-poohed the idea of Anambra Rice have lost their power of speech and insolent dismissiveness, seeing that Anambra Rice is a reality. Governor Obiano has caused Anambra State to be the safest in the country.\n\nIf not in promotion of intrigue, why should anyone suddenly take on the absurd assignment of patching up plumbing that is not leaking? An answer should come from those blabbing that the Anambra North Senatorial district does not deserve the state\u2019s governorship for two terms. Peter Obi served two terms.\n\nPeter Obi was instrumental to Chief Willie Obiano\u2019s emergence as Governor. Who builds to demolish? Are they not rationalising his humanity who hope or pray that Peter Obi will pull the rug from under Obiano\u2019s feet?\n\nOther questions begging for answers. Where lies the integrity of Anambra politicians currently switching political parties as a ploy for wearing the governorship mantle? To see professional loud speakers changing parties with the frequency a fop sheds apparels speaks to a new low in political partisanship. Even if it is assumed that Nigerian politics is ideologically ambivalent, should it also mean that it is bereft of principles?\n\nHow could people who claim affinity with equity question the wisdom of APGA, the political party that decided on slotting the governorship to Anambra North Senatorial zone? Where is the fairness in claiming that Anambra people should be denied excellent leadership because it issues from a place hitherto consigned to perpetual followership?\n\n\n\n\u25cf Iloegbunam, author of Ironside, contributing editor of USAfrica multimedia networks (Houston), since 1995, and USAfricaonline.com, serves as Governor Obiano\u2019s Director of media relations. Waiting for convincing answers may amount to waiting for Godot! Meanwhile, commonsense dictates that the good people of Anambra North should bond together and thwart those intent on introducing the monkey\u2019s hand in the people\u2019s dish. They should join in ensuring that bashers of Anambra heads are not handed the bludgeon of political office that could be handy for pounding the state\u2019s collective head into a bloody pulp.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

    "title": "Sport in 2016: a dichotomy of soaring highs and desperate lows | Richard Williams",
    "text": "It was somehow typical of 2016 that on the morning after Andy Murray accepted the BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year Award for a third time in his career, the focus should switch so joltingly to a man whose strategic brilliance had produced an avalanche of Olympic medals and the first British winner of the Tour de France, but who was now seen trying to persuade a sceptical House of Commons select committee that his team had no involvement with doping.\n\nAndy Murray\u2019s Sports Personality treble shows how he has won over the nation | Kevin Mitchell Read more\n\nThe year has been a rollercoaster like no other before it, the highs (Murray, Leicester City, Simone Biles, the Chicago Cubs, Wales\u2019s footballers, an unusually stirring finish to cricket\u2019s County Championship) higher and the lows (state-sponsored doping, sexual abuse of young footballers, corruption within governing bodies, the plane crash that killed many of Chapecoense\u2019s football team) lower. Now Sir Dave Brailsford, knighted for his services to British sport only four years ago, was being interrogated on his apparent failure to live up to the promises of transparency he made in 2010 when launching Team Sky on the back of a proven Olympic programme and pledging to win the Tour within five years with a clean British rider. His success with Bradley Wiggins in the 2012 Tour, three years ahead of schedule, and with Chris Froome in three of the subsequent four editions of the race, and the clinical manner in which the richest team in the sport went about its business, created resentments that became the kindling for what could yet turn out to be a catastrophic conflagration, with the urgent gusts of social media fanning the flames, as has been the case in so many recent events.\n\nWhat had brought Brailsford up before the select committee \u2013 along with Shane Sutton, his former right-hand man, and already controversial for allegedly making sexist remarks to the female cyclist Jess Varnish \u2013 was the activity of a team of Russian hackers calling themselves Fancy Bears, who had revealed, via Wikileaks, the details of therapeutic use exemption certificates granted to leading athletes in many sports. Those named included Wiggins, and the world was agog to see that he had been given permission for injections of a powerful corticosteroid with known performance-enhancing effects before three big races, ostensibly to mitigate the effects of summertime allergies.\n\nFancy Bears was taken by many to be a jokey nom de guerre for elements of the Russian security services and the revelations appeared to be a reprisal for the ban on Russian athletes competing in the Rio track and field events that followed the disclosure of a clandestine doping programme so ingenious and sophisticated that it made the old East German system look like meals on wheels. A report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency from the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren, issued in two instalments, eventually implicated more than 1,000 athletes. The stories of secret rooms in the testing laboratory and undetected fiddling with supposedly tamper-proof sample flasks cast retrospective doubts over the results from London\u2019s 2012 Olympics and, in particular, the Winter Games in Sochi two years later, where Vladimir Putin\u2019s showpiece facility on the Black Sea had provided the stage for 33 medal-winning performances by competitors from the host nation.\n\nWiggins: \u2018I was paranoid about making excuses. It wasn\u2019t something I was going to shout from the rooftops\u2019 Read more\n\nWiggins had broken no rules but it seemed that he and his team may have pushed against the legal limits and perhaps ventured beyond the boundary of moral acceptability, and he responded by mounting a defence that some found unconvincing. The man who had become so distinctive as a national hero with a Tour and Olympic double in the summer of 2012 grew up in a time when doping was rife in cycling but he could never have dreamed, when he entered his first competition at the age of 12, that he would become a pawn in the geopolitic skirmishes of the 21st century.\n\nIn 2016, however, sport could do no more than mirror the world in which it exists. For every triumph and moment of grace in an overstuffed year, there was a looming shadow ready to cast its darkness over the celebrations. A further 24 hours after Murray\u2019s acceptance of his latest award came the news that another two-times Wimbledon singles champion, the 26-year-old Petra Kvitova, had been stabbed while attempting to defend herself against an intruder at her home in the Czech Republic; the injury was to the tendons of her playing hand, the left, requiring surgery that will keep her out for six months.\n\nDeath claimed an unusually high number of the world\u2019s major figures in 2016 \u2013 and sport was not exempt. As if to match the deaths of Fidel Castro, David Bowie and Umberto Eco, it came up with Muhammad Ali, Johan Cruyff and Arnold Palmer. Each had changed his sport in a way that provided a handy metaphor for developments in society: civil rights protests and opposition to Vietnam war (Ali), the baby-boomers\u2019 drive for self-expression and freedom from archaic restrictions (Cruyff), the monetisation of leisure activities in a time of peace and prosperity for the white bourgeoisie (Palmer). Each, too, gave his name to the thing that symbolised his uniqueness. The Ali shuffle, the Cruyff turn, Arnie\u2019s army: all part of history now, tales to be handed down by those lucky enough to have witnessed them at first hand, and then by those whom they told, perhaps blurring a little but still taking their place in an oral tradition that survives even in the digital age.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Well-wishers touch the hearse carrying the remains of Muhammad Ali during the funeral procession in June.\n\nPhotograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters\n\nAlthough the creation of such legends is in part the job of sport, mostly it exists in order to give pleasure to its participants and relief to its onlookers from the travails and anxieties of everyday existence. In the latter respect, it may be needed more than ever in the years ahead. And if there was something to be said on behalf of 2016, it was the clear evidence that there is no danger of a drying-up of the wellspring of miracles.\n\nAn Olympic year inevitably generates more than its fair share of those. The Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio, prefaced by concerns over their cost to a city and a country with so many millions living in seemingly ineradicable poverty, produced an almost embarrassing haul of 214 medals for the lottery-funded Team GB: a staggering 8.3% of the available total. Too many to record individually, although it should be noted that the track cyclists Laura and Jason Kenny must now find a display case big enough to take their combined collection of 10 gold medals \u2013 and they have not finished yet.\n\nUsain Bolt: \u2018I feel good because I know I\u2019ve done it clean\u2019 Read more\n\nRio also confirmed, almost superfluously, the greatness of Usain Bolt, giving him a trio of gold medals to match his triples in Beijing and London. Elaine Thompson came close to matching her fellow Jamaican, taking gold in the women\u2019s 100m and 200m but missing out by a third of a second when Jamaica finished behind the USA in the 4x100m relay.\n\nFor some observers, Mo Farah\u2019s historic double in the 5,000m and 10,000m made him the pre-eminent British track athlete of all time, as well as the one whose touching and compelling back-story carries a special relevance to a world being reshaped by mass migration. But not even Farah could steer entirely clear of controversy, in his case engendered by accusations against his coach, Alberto Salazar, still lingering from 2015.\n\nRussia\u2019s gymnasts were allowed to compete in Rio, and Aliya Mustafina took the women\u2019s all-around title. But no one could match the way the 19-year-old Simone Biles, 4ft 9in of spring-loaded genius, lit up the world with a series of incandescent displays that elevated her to a level populated by such names as Tourischeva, Korbut, Kim, Comaneci, Retton, Boginskaya, Khorkina and Miller. At the other end of the physical scale, the final of the men\u2019s sculls drew less attention from the non-specialist audience, but no event in the entire Games was more thrillingly, viscerally and closely fought: after an astonishing late attack, Damir Martin of Croatia lost by a thumbnail to Mahe Drysdale of New Zealand, the defending champion, and was the first to bestow the warmest and most unfeigned of congratulations on his conqueror.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest USA\u2019s Simone Biles performs on the floor during the artistic gymnastics women\u2019s apparatus final at the Rio Olympics. Photograph: Julio Cortez/AP\n\nIf that was a shining example of sport at the highest level finding space for a sense of brotherhood, fraternal competition acquired a new and unforgettable dimension when Alistair Brownlee, a double Olympic triathlon champion, first caught his younger brother Jonny, close to collapse near the end of the final World Series round in Cozumel, Mexico, then carried him across the line. It would have been no surprise to find the Hollies\u2019 He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother topping the charts the following week.\n\nLeicester City\u2019s triumph: the inside story of an extraordinary season | Stuart James Read more\n\nLeicester City\u2019s success in vanquishing the big battalions was the best bit of image-enhancement the Premier League could have devised on the eve of its obscene new television deal: a real-life fairytale supervised by Claudio Ranieri, a man of unfailing modesty, courtesy and charm. The deeds of the formerly unheralded Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 were almost enough to make the nation forget the damage done to other historic clubs by such incompetent owners as Roland Duch\u00e2telet at Charlton Athletic, Venky\u2019s at Blackburn Rovers, Tony Fernandes at Queens Park Rangers, Massimo Cellino at Leeds United and the hedge fund Sisu at Coventry City.\n\nPortugal\u2019s victory in Euro 2016 rewarded the efforts of another underdog, all the more praiseworthy for the way Fernando Santos\u2019s players overcame the loss of Cristiano Ronaldo, their captain and talisman, after only 25 minutes of the final against hosts France, refusing to allow their morale to crack in the way that Brazil had permitted Neymar\u2019s absence to undermine them in the 2014 World Cup. If anything, adversity was the making of a performance crowned by Eder\u2019s decisive extra-time goal.\n\nWales and Iceland, and their bands of wonderful supporters, had already given the tournament its flavour. By the time of their departure, at the semi-final and quarter-final stages respectively, the players of England were already on the beach or by the pool or wherever they had gone to wash away the humiliation of a deserved last-16 defeat at the hands of the representatives of 330,000 Nordic islanders. Elimination ensured the end of Roy Hodgson, a decent man but never quite up to the job. The more bullish Sam Allardyce replaced him, thus realising his loudly proclaimed life\u2019s ambition, but there was a sense of suppressed relief emanating from the FA bosses who accepted his resignation after only 67 days, one sketchy victory and an outlay, all told, of around \u00a34.5m. His replacement, the civilised but untested Gareth Southgate, duly went about the time-honoured business of creating unrealistic expectations with decent results in qualifying matches against minnows.\n\nIn what has been declared the first year of a new post-truth age, sport had its ration of fake news when the England rugby international James Haskell was maliciously declared to have succumbed to a steroid overdose. The babble of Twitter and Facebook may even have contributed to the decision by Nico Rosberg to retire 24 hours after winning the Formula One world title; who could blame anyone for declining to remain any more than a day longer than necessary inside a world of fanboys and haters whose rancour drowns even the blare of racing engines? His team-mate, Lewis Hamilton, became the first driver to win 10 races in the season without also taking the championship, while in the motorcycle world Cal Crutchlow made himself the first Brit to win a top-tier race since Barry Sheene, and then did it again \u2013 both times on a second-tier machine.\n\nCal Crutchlow\u2019s MotoGP triumph in Brno deserves Olympian acclaim | Richard Williams Read more\n\nThe final day of the dear old County Championship, a survivor of the analogue age forever under threat from modernity, saw Middlesex clinch the title for the first time since 1993 by beating Yorkshire in front of 10,000 spectators on a Friday evening at Lord\u2019s, with only five overs of the season remaining. Somerset, the other contenders for the title when the day began, could only watch helplessly from the sidelines.\n\nCricket also provided one of three individual examples of excellence from the year which stand out in their very different ways \u2013 two of them spectacular, the other the essence of understatement. With West Indies needing 19 off the final over to beat England in the World Twenty20 final in Kolkata, the Barbadian all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite smashed four consecutive sixes off the bowling of Ben Stokes in the most majestically brutal climax to a sporting contest ever witnessed outside a boxing ring. Second, Fiji\u2019s joyful rout of Team GB in the rugby sevens final in Rio: a lesson in initiative, inspiration, skill, courage and, oh, just about everything. Third, the contribution of Chris Robshaw \u2013 replaced as captain of the England XV after a disaster in the 2015 Rugby World Cup \u2013 to the team\u2019s current year-long 13-match winning run, embracing anonymity and making himself as essential to the collective success as his blindside predecessor Richard Hill was to the World Cup winners of 2003.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vatemo Ravouvou of Fiji evades Dan Bibby of Great Britain during the men\u2019s rugby sevens gold medal match in Rio. Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images\n\nDylan Hartley, the man selected by Eddie Jones to replace Robshaw as captain, performed valiantly and behaved impeccably throughout the unbeaten international year but then ended it by elbowing a Leinster opponent on his return to Northampton colours. The resulting ban took his career aggregate of suspensions to 60 weeks: more than an entire year of the 30 he has so far spent on earth, all imposed for various forms of unacceptable violence.\n\nEngland report card: five areas to focus on before the Ashes series next winter | Rob Smyth Read more\n\nLeadership on the field is also an issue for England\u2019s Test cricket team after a bruising 4-0 series defeat in India. A good start to the year, with series victories against South Africa on tour and Sri Lanka at home, was followed by drawn series against Pakistan at home and Bangladesh away. Now Alastair Cook will spend the holiday deciding whether to step aside and allow his vice-captain, Joe Root, to take over, giving the Yorkshireman the summer meetings with South Africa and West Indies in which to get his bearings before setting off to retain the Ashes in Australia. Eoin Morgan captained England\u2019s ODI squad to a series defeat in South Africa and home wins against Sri Lanka and Pakistan before declining on security grounds to travel to Bangladesh, allowing Jos Buttler to lead the team to another series victory.\n\nFinally, a normally reliable source suggests that Bernie Ecclestone will at last be stepping down from his role as the supreme dictator of Formula One in the early weeks of next year, at the age of 86. But given that he is on such excellent personal terms with both Donald Trump (\u201cHis election is the best thing that could have happened to the world\u201d) and Vladimir Putin (\u201cHe gets the job done \u2013 he should be running Europe\u201d), it is hard to imagine him passing up the chance of joining them to form a troika bent on world domination. Either way, it\u2019s something to look forward to in 2017.",

    "title": "War-Torn Yemen Is Letting Its Zoo Animals Starve to Death",
    "text": "View Images A malnourished lion stares out of a blood- and urine-soaked cage. Eleven lions died of starvation after they were abandoned at Yemen\u2019s Taiz Zoological Gardens in early 2016.\n\nPhotograph by Mercury Press, Caters News\n\nWar births refugees. Streaming out of blasted-out cities, civilians are forced to flee their homes, sometimes their families, away from the bombs, into the unknown.\n\nWhat happens when you can\u2019t leave? That\u2019s the story of abandoned zoos in wartime. It\u2019s the story unfolding now for the animals in Yemen\u2019s Taiz Zoological Gardens, neglected in the cross fire of the country\u2019s civil war. Here 28 Arabian leopards, critically endangered in the wild, haven\u2019t eaten in six days. They and nearly 240 other animals face imminent death if they aren\u2019t fed very soon.\n\nThe story began early this year when the Yemeni government, which runs the zoo, stopped paying the staff and abandoned the facility in the face of escalating violence. In February, after a media flurry drew international attention to the deteriorating conditions at the zoo, SOS Zoo and Bear Rescue\u2014a rescue organization established on Facebook by Chantal Jonkergouw\u2014began raising funds to cover the cost of food, water, and care for the animals. According to Jonkergouw, who lives in Sweden, SOS has raised more than $125,000 from individual donors during the past ten months.\n\nOn November 30 she made the agonizing decision to stop feeding the animals until the government agrees to release them to rescuers. She says they\u2019re still getting fresh water every day.\n\nA local Good Samaritan then stepped in to bring the leopards and other meat eaters food, but he hasn\u2019t been seen since December 16\u2014the last time the carnivores were fed. The zoo\u2019s herbivores have been subsisting on a rapidly diminishing supply of rotten vegetables. According to Bassam Al-Hakimi, SOS\u2019s project manager in Taiz, many of the animals are showing signs of extreme weakness.\n\nView Images These Arabian leopards, critically endangered in the wild, haven't been fed since December 16.\n\nPhotograph by Mercury Press, Caters News\n\n\"As they grow hungrier, the stronger ones might prey on the weaker ones,\u201d Jonkergouw says. \u201cEspecially the big cats. Stress also can have a very negative effect on the animals' behavior. Personally, I think that most of them will lie down and die slowly.\"\n\nTaiz, considered Yemen\u2019s cultural capital, has been a flashpoint in the country\u2019s ongoing civil war, a clash between Shia Muslim Houthis and Saudi-backed forces loyal to the nation\u2019s pre-war government. The Taiz zoo became an overlooked casualty of the war after the government lost control of the city and many zoo workers fled the bombings and food shortages that have plagued the region.\n\nView Images A lion wastes away, abscesses ravaging its body. Facilities in the United Arab Emirates and Jordan have offered to rescue the zoo\u2019s animals, but the Yemeni government refuses to allow their evacuation.\n\nPhotograph by Mercury Press, Caster News\n\nAccording to Jonkergouw, before SOS intervened on February, 11 lions and six Arabian leopards had starved to death. \u201cOne leopard had eaten its female companion,\u201d she says. The surviving animals were found living in squalor on bare concrete, bloodied, with festering abscesses, feces everywhere. One drastically malnourished lion was found with his hip bone jutting through his skin. Emergency surgery saved his life, barely.\n\nOther animals in the zoo include hyenas, monkeys, birds, porcupines, baboons, and guinea pigs. Many of the creatures have displayed signs of severe zoochosis\u2014a condition that often afflicts animals kept captive in artificial environments and is characterized by obsessive, repetitive behaviors. The din and detritus of war may compound the suffering: In mid-December a nearby building was bombed, spraying shrapnel into the zoo\u2019s grounds.\n\nThe proximity of the fighting complicates rescue efforts: Other than the SOS-funded Tamdeen Youth Foundation, a local group that has provided all food, care, and water for the animals, no other organization has been involved on the ground\u2014it\u2019s too dangerous.\n\nThe Yemeni government, which now has limited sway in Taiz, has denied the transfer permits that might at least give the animals a chance of being extracted from Houthi territory and brought to another country where they would have hope for long-term survival.\n\nSOS has kept the animals alive at a cost of $4,000 a week, covering food and care and modest salaries for a small staff of six, Jonkergouw says. SOS had just $10,000 left when at the end of last month she decided to cut off the food supplies.\n\n\u201cWithout [the Yemeni government] being cooperative towards finding a real solution, I don't think it's acceptable any longer\u201d for SOS to provide the funding and care that the government won\u2019t, she says. \u201cThey need to feel it. The problem is, it's at the expense of the animals, but there's no other option. Whatever we do, the animals will suffer.\u201d\n\nEvacuating so many captive animals from the heart of a war zone would present the Yemeni government with a dangerous logistical challenge, but offers of safe havens have been made.\n\nThe Princess Alia Foundation in Jordan and the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife in the United Arab Emirates, in conjunction with that country\u2019s Al Ain Zoo, have both said they\u2019d take the animals. It could cost up to $500,000 USD to evacuate the zoo, which would require armed guards to ensure safe exit. Jonkergouw is confident that her organization and others could raise the money with aid from NGOs but emphasizes that Yemen first needs to agree to facilitate an evacuation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, the body that monitors the conservation status of species, has actively been trying to broker an agreement between Yemen and the UAE-based rescue facilities, to no avail yet.\n\nYemeni government officials have told Jonkergouw that they won\u2019t entertain either offer. \u201cThey replied that they will never let the animals out of Yemen and that the animals were well cared for and doing fine. And then I really got pissed,\u201d Jonkergouw says. \u201cI said, why are they fine? I raised $125,000 and paid most of that into this project without getting any real cooperation on a sustainable solution for these animals. So I'm fed up with this. I will stop.\u201d\n\nThe Yemeni government, which now has limited sway in Taiz, has denied the transfer permits that might at least give the animals a chance of being extracted.\n\nAn official from Yemen\u2019s Environment Protection Authority, which has represented the government in talks with Jonkergouw, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Leopard Factor\n\nThere are likely only about 80 wild Arabian leopards left on the planet. The Taiz Zoo has 28, including two cubs born in September. Jonkergouw believes Yemen is reluctant to send the cats to another country, even temporarily, because Arabian leopards, as the national animal, are a source of deep pride.\n\nAny loss of Arabian leopards is devastating, given how rare the species is. Four cubs disappeared from the zoo shortly after SOS stepped in. Zoo officials at the time said they were probably eaten. Jonkergouw raises the possibility that they were stolen and sold on the black market. (The Arabian peninsula has a sizable black market for exotic cats as pets.) After that incident she arranged for a full-time armed guard for the leopards.\n\nNow the very thing keeping the leopards trapped in Taiz\u2014their prized status in Yemen\u2014could be the key to their salvation. If the leopards begin dying of starvation, Jonkergouw hopes the government may relent and allow the transfer of the leopards and all the other animals. \u201cProbably more leopards have to die before they realize that they have to evacuate them,\u201d she says.\n\nShe intends to start feeding the animals again as soon as Yemen signs a letter of intent permitting rescue by the facilities in Jordan or the UAE, or outlining an alternative plan. She would rather see the animals euthanized than face death by starvation but doubts that will happen. \u201cI don\u2019t think the zoo will cooperate with euthanizing them,\u201d she says.\n\nWhere To Go From Here\n\nThe situation is getting more dire by the day. With only two of the original six workers still at the zoo, there aren\u2019t enough hands to keep the cages clean, though starvation will likely kill the animals before sepsis does. No one is currently guarding the leopards.\n\nGail A\u2019Brunzo, Animal Rescue Manager at the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), a U.S.-based NGO that rescues and protects animals and their habitats around the world, commends what SOS Zoo and Bear Rescue has been doing to keep the animals alive. She acknowledges that there seems no recourse other than \u201cto cease operations in a last-ditch effort to try and persuade the government to step up. A heartbreaking decision on their part, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nJonkergouw says she is often asked how she can justify wanting to save animals in a war zone when people are dying and suffering. \u201cIt's humans who put these animals there,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re our responsibility. There's so much human suffering in the world, and there will be much more in the future. If you take that as the starting point, then you\u2019ll never get to the welfare of the animals. It's always an excuse to not [act]. It's our responsibility.\u201d\n\nFor updates about the ongoing situation at the Taiz Zoo, visit SOS Zoo and Bear Rescue on Facebook and partner organization, A Lion's Heart.",

    "text": "Everything from alertness to body temperature fluctuates based on where our bodies in our 24-hour biological clock called circadian rhythm, explains Michael Howell, MD, CEO of Sleep Performance Institute in Edina, Minnesota. \"Our circadian rhythms are primarily determined by when we are exposed to light, and our modern culture's affinity to light in the evening (computer, tablet, television, and phone screens) activates a cell layer in our retina sending a signal that delays our circadian rhythm. That means that it could be 10 p.m., but the brain will think the sun is still out, so it won't be ready to fall asleep\u2014no matter how tired you actually are.\" Another problem could be a circadian rhythm delay, which is probably what's happening when the alarm clock goes off, but you're not ready to wake up yet. \"If you have trouble falling asleep at night but can sleep in easily in the morning, you probably have a delay in your circadian rhythm. This problem is solved with bright light (sunlight or a 10,000 lux light box used first thing in the morning) along with low dose (0.5mg) of melatonin about three to four hours before bedtime.\" Here are some more tips to improve your sleep-ready routine",

    "text": "In some parts of Austin, runaway pets are likely to stay lost.\n\nThat\u2019s what an analysis by the city\u2019s Animal Services Department has found. While roughly one animal for every 100 residents gets brought into a shelter citywide, three ZIP codes in East Austin \u2013 78702, 78724 and 78617 \u2013 have intake rates two and three times higher than the average. According to a recent affordability report by the city, most of the households in these ZIP codes make less than $52,458 a year.\n\nThe city also found that the number of 311 calls about loose animals is much higher in these areas, while the rate at which pets are returned to owners is much lower.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something happening in the lives of the pet and the family where a bond is being broken and the pets are simply not being reclaimed,\u201d said Chief Animal Services Officer Tawny Hammond. \u201cSo we kind of want to talk to the community and find out what (their) needs might be.\u201d\n\nBeginning in February, the city of Austin will hire four additional animal protection officers to staff a two-year pilot program in these ZIP codes. The goal is to determine, and then put into place, what the community needs in order to bring down high intake numbers and increase the likelihood that a pet is returned to its owner.\n\nThe first priority, said Hammond, is to assess what pet-related resources these neighborhoods currently have.\n\nShe offered the following as potential queries: \u201cAre there low-cost clinics? Are there veterinarians? Is there affordable pet-friendly housing? Are there dog parks? Are there recreational opportunities? Are there pet stores?\u201d\n\nHammond said solutions could be as simple as assisting families with pet identification or advocating for more pet-friendly housing in the area.\n\n\u201cSometimes a microchip might be the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cA collar and tag. A leash. Help with fixing a gate. Help with fixing a fence. Temporary housing help.\u201d\n\nThe program will be paid for by part of a $1.1 million grant from Maddie\u2019s Fund, an organization that awards grants to no-kill shelters. If it proves successful, said Hammond, the department might consider taking a more community-centered approach to other parts of Austin with high animal intake rates.\n\nThis story was produced as part of KUT's reporting partnership with the Austin Monitor.",

    "text": "The Village of Sleepy Hollow is well lit this holiday season, thanks to a grant paying for 60 of 90 street lights being switched to LEDs.\n\n\"ComEd contacted our village, because they thought our municipality would qualify for their new streetlight program,\" said Mayor Stephan Pickett.\n\nAccording to The Legend, the village's winter newsletter, \"LED street lighting technology substantially reduces the amount of energy needed to illuminate the roadway which equates directly into energy savings.\"\n\n\"The village expects to reduce its electric bill by 50 percent with these new lights,\" Pickett said.\n\nWith the village owning 60 of the streetlights and ComEd 30, the exact cost of the project for the village is still being determined, said Ellen Volkening, finance department director.\n\nBut any savings is welcomed since finances are a problem in Sleepy Hollow. After a funding measure was passed in the spring, the village has been re-introducing services such as lawn mowing, and this latest project of replacing numerous burned-out light fixtures has greatly improved the look of the streets in the newer subdivisions.\n\n\"Older areas in the village do not have street lights and residents rely on putting their porch lights on to provide lighting,\" Pickett said. \"The cost would be prohibitive for installing street lights in those neighborhoods that presently do not have them.\"\n\nThe new lights in the Saddle Club subdivision are bright and clean and definitely make the streets easier to maneuver when driving in the dark. I had been concerned about the darkness on the streets, and noticed immediately when the new fixtures had been installed.\n\nThe acceptance into the Com-Ed LED street light program has been a positive for the village by providing light fixtures that will last longer, give out more light, cut electrical costs, and make driving on affected neighborhood streets safer.\n\nVillage residents, who had expressed concern over a lack of working street lights, can rest easier now that the lights are back on.\n\nLinda McDaniel-Hale is a Fox Valley resident who offers opinion on local topics.",

    "title": "Will We Soon Be Riding on Solar Roads? The Idea Gains Traction",
    "text": "Solar is popping up just about everywhere, even landfills and parka pockets. So why not roads? Indeed, solar road projects are gaining interest around the world, and some promise to even charge electric cars while moving.\n\nThe Netherlands built the first solar road, a bike path, in 2014. France announced a bolder move in January\u2014over the next five years, it plans to install 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of solar roads, designed to supply power to five million people.\n\nIn fact, on December 22, France opened the world's first solar road for cars, in a Normandy village. The 0.6-mile route in Tourouvre-au-Perche is covered with 2,800 square meters of electricity-generating solar panels. The goal is powering street lighting.\n\nThe project, which cost around 5 million Euros, is expected to be used by about 2,000 motorists a day.\n\nGerman company Solmove aims to bring solar panels to German roads, and Idaho-based Solar Roadways has received three rounds of U.S. government funding (plus $2 million in venture capital) to test its technology.\n\n\u201cWe have interested customers from all 50 states and most countries around the world,\u201d says Julie Brusaw, who co-founded Solar Roadways with her engineer husband Scott. She says before hitting the open road, they\u2019re testing their panels in non-critical areas such as parking lots, walkways, and their own driveway.\n\n\u201cWe are in talks about some very interesting projects,\u201d she says, noting the Missouri Department of Transportation wants to install the panels at a rest area along the I-70 highway. The couple say their tempered-glass panels offer asphalt-like traction, support the weight of semi-trucks, include LEDs for signage, and contain heating elements to melt snow and ice.\n\nCould solar panels really pave the roads of the future? Proponents see endless possibilities, but others raise questions about cost, efficiency, and durability.\n\n\u201cWe just place our solar panels on an existing pavement,\u201d says Jean-Luc Gautier, inventor of the Wattway technology that will be tested this spring in France before its polycrystalline silicon layer is applied to actual roads. Gautier, technical director at construction company Colas, says he was inspired by the fact that roads look at the sky so they can collect solar energy.\n\nView Images Julie and Scott Bursaw, an Idaho couple who co-founded Solar Roadways, poses in front of a prototype for their solar-embedded pavement. Photograph by Solar Roadways\n\n\u201cThe sheer amount of surfaces each country devotes to roadways is enormous,\u201d the Bursaws write on their website. \u201cAllowing this space to double as a solar farm could have very positive implications in the battle to put a halt to climate change.\u201d They estimate that their panels, if used in lieu of existing U.S. roads and walkways, could produce more than three times the electricity used in the United States.\n\nBesides, they say their panels could charge electric vehicles, first on solar parking lots. With enough solar highways and cars with the right equipment (to pick up energy from induction plates in the road) they might even be able to charge vehicles while moving.\n\nThe Cost Challenge\n\n\u201cIn theory, solar PV roadways sound great. The issue is cost.\u201d says Mark Jacobson, an engineering professor at Stanford University who has promoted a plan for powering the U.S. solely with renewable energy. (Read about his blueprint for a carbon-free America.)\n\n\u201cAside from road dust, particularly black tire dust and diesel exhaust, which will quickly cover a portion of each panel, the continuous traffic covering panels will reduce their solar output,\u201d says Jacobson, adding they\u2019ll likely suffer more wear and tear and need more repairs than other solar panels.\n\nHe also says that while they don\u2019t require land acquisition costs, as do solar power plants, their panels cannot be rotated for optimal solar exposure. He expects a solar road won\u2019t be able to compete on cost, but \u201cI\u2019m hopeful it will.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstalling photovoltaics in roads seems like a daft idea at first, \u201csays a report last month by IDTechEx, an independent research and consulting firm. \u201cA closer look reveals that most of the problems are easily overcome and even at poor efficiency, that local electricity has viable uses.\u201d\n\nDespite high costs, company chairman Peter Harrop says solar roads might work in places that are putting down roads for the first time. \u201cThey need early (technology) adopters like China that want to leapfrog in development.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, \u201cI can\u2019t see solar roads in London,\u201d he says, noting the city often digs up its roads for underground repairs.\n\nSo far, the Netherlands\u2019 solar path is popular. In its first year, 300,000 bikes and mopeds rode the initial 70-meter (230-foot) stretch connecting two Amsterdam suburbs. Officials say the SolaRoad produced more energy last year than expected\u2014enough to power three households. It\u2019s made of crystalline silicon solar cells, encased in concrete and covered with a translucent layer of tempered glass.\n\nIn the U.S., Solar Roadways has received more than $1.5 million from the Department of Transportation over the last six years to develop and test its hexagonal-shaped panels.\n\n\u201cOne of the shortcomings Solar Roadways has yet to resolve is the manufacturing process,\u201d two DOT officials wrote in a December post, noting the solar cells are handmade and thus \u201cvery costly\u201d to produce. Julie Bursaw says the company's most recent prototype is less costly to produce, 25 percent more efficident, and easier to install.\n\nThe DOT officials, Michael Trentacoste and Robert C. Johns, say the agency has received \u201ca lot of positive feedback\u201d about the project; the company\u2019s promotional video has 21 million views on YouTube. Because the panels can melt snow or keep water from freezing, even with high costs, they say the innovation \u201ccould still be useful in smaller areas such as parking lots, sidewalks, driveways, and bike lanes.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published on March 10, 2016 and was updated on December 22, 2016 with information about the opening of the solar road in France.\n\nThe story is part of a special series that explores energy issues.

    "text": "(a quick blog posting from today)\n\nPandora's passports\n\n\n\nMay 27th 2010, 13:50 by E.L. | LONDON\n\n\n\nIN SOME parts of the world, having two or even three passports is nothing unusual. Plenty of people in Ireland (north and south) have both British and Irish passports; a sprinkling have American ones too. Even countries that frown on dual citizenship rarely make much of a fuss about it (not least because it is so hard to police). That lesson seems to be lost on Slovak and Hungarian politicians, who are cooking up an almighty row about the Hungarian new dual citizenship law which will give all ethnic Hungarians outside the country the near-automatic right to a Hungarian passport. The new law, passed by parliament on May 26th, removes the requirement for permanent residency in Hungary; in future, applications will simply need to show they speak Hungarian and have some Hungarian ethnic roots (such as a Hungarian grandparent).\n\n\n\nFor Hungarians, that salves a wound that has been open since 1920, when the Treaty of Trianon dismembered old Hungary, leaving more than three out of ten Hungarians stranded in other countries such as newly independent Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and a much bigger Romania. Giving passports to these Hungarians, who now number around 2m, appeases the radical right in Hungary and also signals to other countries that the Magyar minorities have a protector. That does not matter much in places such as Serbia, Slovenia or Austria, where Magyars live happily alongside their fellow-citizens. But it is potentially explosive in Slovakia, where some in the Slav majority are twitchy about what they see as the uppitiness of the ethnic Hungarian minority, who number about 10% of the population. Slovakia has annoyed Hungary, and alarmed some outsiders, with a poorly-drafted language law that in some cases penalises the use of the Hungarian language.\n\n\n\nSo Slovakia has protested, appealed to outsiders, and now says it will strip dual passport-holders of their Slovak citizenship. In theory, the fact that both countries belong to the European Union should mean that passports are largely irrelevant. Hungarian passport-holders have the right to work and live in Slovakia just like any other EU citizen. But these sort of ethnic-historical squabbles are just the sort of thing that EU enlargement was meant to settle. It is troubling to see them bubbling up. When Slovakia's new government takes office at the end of June, outsiders will be hoping to see some serious diplomacy between Bratislava and Budapest.\n\n\n\nIt is also odd to see ethnicity taking such precedence over more modern forms of political identity. The term \"ethnic Hungarian\" is convenient journalistic shorthand but a poor basis for legislation. There are people who speak excellent Hungarian but have no Hungarian ancestry, and others with pure Magyar blood (nasty term) who happen not to speak the language. It would take a new Nuremberg Law to determine exactly what level of Hungarian ancestry counts as sufficient.\n\n\n\nHungary would be on stronger ground if chose political-historical rather than an ethnic base for the law. For example, it could say that anyone whose ancestors were citizens of the old Hungarian Kingdom had the right to apply for a passport from the modern republic. (Estonia and Latvia took that approach when they regained independence in 1991, giving passports automatically to all citizens of the pre-war republics, regardless of ethnicity, while asking Soviet-era migrants to apply). If Hungary did the same, it is a fair bet that few non-Magyars would bother to take up the offer.\n\n",

    "text": "Dear Amy: For many years, my 92-year-old father and I have been bitterly disagreeing about his climbing on ladders and high step stools to change light bulbs.\n\nHis balance is poor, and I've seen him almost fall many times.\n\nLast week he fell backward at a restaurant, hit his head and had to go to the ER for stitches.\n\nTwo days later I saw him walk down the hall with a tall step stool to check the fire alarm, which I ended up climbing up and checking for him.\n\nMonths ago my husband saw my father about to get on a tall step stool to change a light fixture outside and suggested we have our contractor do it, but my father wouldn't listen, so my father had my husband, who is prone to seizures, climb up to fix the light fixture -- putting my husband's life in danger.\n\nI was furious. His neighbour was so concerned about his getting on ladders she said that if she ever saw him on one, she would call the police.\n\nHe is so stubborn. How would you suggest I get him to stop this extremely dangerous endeavor? I am so angry and I don't want him to die.\n\n-- Angry in Sausalito\n\nDear Angry: Here's what you need to know, and this is a certainty: Your father is going to die. You don't want him to, but he will. To some extent, he is choosing how things will go -- by stubbornly maintaining his independent wish to do as he pleases, regardless of the danger and likely consequences.\n\nYou have fought this bitter battle with him for years. You could try to convince him to make a list of household chores so that during your visits you can perform some of these tasks, but he doesn't sound likely to comply.\n\nIt's important for you to realize that your father could trip on a rug in the kitchen, injure himself bathing, or in countless other ways.\n\nUnless you would like to move in with him to try to protect him from his own impulses, I think you should try to let this go.\n\nDear Amy: I am a 26-year-old woman from Hong Kong living in London. I met this guy through a dating app. We were very compatible in every way. I was recovering from a fling. He left a six-year relationship just after they became engaged.\n\nWe almost got to the point where we hung out like a couple, knowing each other's friends and family. I asked him where this relationship was heading. (I know I shouldn't have, but I couldn't help it.)\n\nHe replied that he really liked me. He was about to go to Burma for a short trip, so he said he would give me an answer after the trip. After the trip, he told me he is likely moving there to start a business with his friend. He said he doesn't want a relationship with anyone right now.\n\nI believe him, but it's still upsetting, I have never been with a guy who I can see a future with. However, I also saw a lot of red flags. He didn't pay for the first date. Since the third or fourth dates, I always initiated getting together.\n\nI want to make him realize how uniquely compatible we are. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n-- J\n\nDear J: I wish I had suggestions on ways to prove that you are compatible with this guy, but you're not compatible with this guy.\n\nHe is not that into you. If he was, he would be demonstrating his interest in exactly the same ways you are demonstrating yours: initiating getting together, for instance, and by not making plans to move to another country.\n\nYou have done nothing wrong -- you are simply at different points in your lives.

    "title": "Acer decides to discontinue smartphone selling in India",
    "text": "Even though India is considered to be one of the largest markets for smartphone makers, not everyone has been successful in marketing and selling themselves in that region. That is why Taiwanese brand Acer has decided to discontinue their \u201cinsignificant\u201d mobile business in the country and instead focus on their laptop and other hardware business, which has met with relatively better success. Apparently, they are not willing to risk investing when there are more and more brands going into the market.\n\nSix years ago, Acer opened its mobile business in India after years of being in the PC industry. When Chinese companies started aggressively going into the region, bringing their entry level and mid-tier devices, they decided to focus on being as aggressive with their smartphones. But it seems like it\u2019s not enough one year later, and so they made the decision to not pursue the market anymore. Harish Kohli, Managing Director for Acer India said that the changing government policies have made it difficult for bigger brands to make an impact so it has been left to the smaller ones to duke it out.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just government policies that have led to their failure, at least in the smartphone business. According to analysts, they did not scale the distribution of their smartphones and they were also unable to get the attention of the younger market. Brands like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and even local brand Yu targeted the right segment through online flash sales and other promotions that captured the attention of the young people who had the buying power.\n\nDespite the fact that they are still one of the top computer sellers in India, the failure of their mobile segment will still have a significant effect on their global smartphone numbers. And as more and more players enter the market, it will be an even tougher sell for Acer to gain a foothold if they do not have a major, successful line.\n\nVIA: Mashable",

    "title": "Elderly father climbs to new heights",
    "text": "Dear Amy: For many years, my 92-year-old father and I have been bitterly disagreeing about his climbing on ladders and high step stools to change light bulbs.\n\nHis balance is poor, and I've seen him almost fall many times.\n\nLast week he fell backward at a restaurant, hit his head and had to go to the ER for stitches.\n\nTwo days later I saw him walk down the hall with a tall step stool to check the fire alarm, which I ended up climbing up and checking for him.\n\nMonths ago my husband saw my father about to get on a tall step stool to change a light fixture outside and suggested we have our contractor do it, but my father wouldn't listen, so my father had my husband, who is prone to seizures, climb up to fix the light fixture -- putting my husband's life in danger.\n\nI was furious. His neighbour was so concerned about his getting on ladders she said that if she ever saw him on one, she would call the police.\n\nHe is so stubborn. How would you suggest I get him to stop this extremely dangerous endeavor? I am so angry and I don't want him to die.\n\n-- Angry in Sausalito\n\nDear Angry: Here's what you need to know, and this is a certainty: Your father is going to die. You don't want him to, but he will. To some extent, he is choosing how things will go -- by stubbornly maintaining his independent wish to do as he pleases, regardless of the danger and likely consequences.\n\nYou have fought this bitter battle with him for years. You could try to convince him to make a list of household chores so that during your visits you can perform some of these tasks, but he doesn't sound likely to comply.\n\nIt's important for you to realize that your father could trip on a rug in the kitchen, injure himself bathing, or in countless other ways.\n\nUnless you would like to move in with him to try to protect him from his own impulses, I think you should try to let this go.\n\nDear Amy: I am a 26-year-old woman from Hong Kong living in London. I met this guy through a dating app. We were very compatible in every way. I was recovering from a fling. He left a six-year relationship just after they became engaged.\n\nWe almost got to the point where we hung out like a couple, knowing each other's friends and family. I asked him where this relationship was heading. (I know I shouldn't have, but I couldn't help it.)\n\nHe replied that he really liked me. He was about to go to Burma for a short trip, so he said he would give me an answer after the trip. After the trip, he told me he is likely moving there to start a business with his friend. He said he doesn't want a relationship with anyone right now.\n\nI believe him, but it's still upsetting, I have never been with a guy who I can see a future with. However, I also saw a lot of red flags. He didn't pay for the first date. Since the third or fourth dates, I always initiated getting together.\n\nI want to make him realize how uniquely compatible we are. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n-- J\n\nDear J: I wish I had suggestions on ways to prove that you are compatible with this guy, but you're not compatible with this guy.\n\nHe is not that into you. If he was, he would be demonstrating his interest in exactly the same ways you are demonstrating yours: initiating getting together, for instance, and by not making plans to move to another country.\n\nYou have done nothing wrong -- you are simply at different points in your lives. I think it is great that you have had the experience of being with someone where you are feeling these wonderful feelings and where you realize that you want to have a relationship. Consider this realization his gift to you. Accept this gift, and move on.\n\nDear Amy: I was shocked when you told \"Heartbroken\" that his wife's choice to work out at the gym every day indicated that their marriage was in trouble. Maybe this woman just wants to get healthy!\n\n-- Fit Wife\n\nDear Fit: Along with other changes in this woman's life, sudden frequent gym attendance and losing weight are indicators that the marriage might be in trouble.",

    "title": "The fashion industry really wants you to wear pajamas on the street \u2014 don\u2019t do it!",
    "text": "Designers really want to turn fancy pajamas into glamorous streetwear. The average shopper seems unconvinced.\n\nYet the fashion industry will not let this idea go, despite your reluctance to wear a pair of silk pajamas to a cocktail party. Indeed, in an uncharacteristic display of independence, confidence and adherence to civility, consumers have been immune to the concept. They\u2019ve ignored the celebrity endorsements and the cache of designer labels.\n\nThe nation is bravely refusing the normalization of pajamas. Shoppers, stay strong.\n\nMind you, designers are not touting basic cotton PJs, flannel onesies or even filmy nightgowns. They want you to wear extremely fancy silk pajamas and dressing gowns \u2013 the sort that you might sleep in, if you had a manservant dressing your bed in Pratesi sheets and Herm\u00e8s throws. The point of these pajamas, however, is not sleep. They are intended to be glammed up with chic shoes and a handbag, a slash of red lipstick and a significant amount of chutzpah. Perhaps a robe top over trousers and a dress shirt. You\u2019re supposed to wear this look to a holiday party. Or celebratory dinner. Or to the mall.\n\nA significant portion of the fashion industry has gotten behind this notion. Last week, a Givenchy floral pajama top was for sale on the Neiman Marcus website for $811, marked down from the original $1,690. That was just for the top; the bottoms were extra. At Saks Fifth Avenue, customers will find a Gucci corsage-print silk pajama top priced at $2,200 and the bottoms at $1,300. And in September, when Bouchra Jarrar debuted her spring 2017 Lanvin collection, the focus of the line was boudoir looks, including a particularly striking black-and-white striped robe worn as a blazer.\n\nFurther down the fashion food chain, Victoria\u2019s Secret is selling \u201cafter hours satin pajamas.\u201d And J. Crew has a pajama shirt paired with jeans as well as a pajama jumpsuit styled with one of its black Regency blazers and black flats.\n\nTo be clear, these are not pajama-style garments, nor trousers that simply borrow the loose fit and drape of sleepwear. Ostensibly, these are pajamas, promoted for both men and women. Indeed, in recent years, entire brands have been born solely to cater to the idea that people should wear fancy pajamas on the street. The Italian brand F.R.S. (both the founder\u2019s initials and an abbreviation of \u201cfor restless sleepers\u201d) uses fabrics patterns and rich colours that call to mind life in a Medici palazzo. Piamita was founded by two fashion editors in 2011 with fashion pajamas as its early focus. They ooze charm.\n\nAll of these garments have luxurious fabrics, elaborate patterns, saturated colours, comfortable silhouettes. They are, in fact, quite handsome. But they look precisely like what they, in fact, are: Pajamas.\n\nAnd they are thriving \u2013 within the fashion ecosystem, anyway. In the spring, Dolce & Gabbana hosted a \u201cpajama party\u201d in Los Angeles, where guests Naomi Campbell and Jessica Alba were decked out in pajamas. The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Booth Moore recalls the model Gigi Hadid wearing a pajama jumpsuit on the red carpet. Moore has also seen the look at fashion-y Los Angeles parties. She, herself, owns a lovely pajama shirt, purchased from a shop in Paris. But have any of these looks really been spotted in the wild?\n\nMoore, author of \u201cWhere Stylists Shop,\u201d says she hasn\u2019t seen it. Not even in Los Angeles, the city that turned pink velour track suits into a fashion statement.\n\nRelated\n\nMeanwhile, on the East Coast: \u201cIt\u2019s a look I haven\u2019t seen hit the streets very much,\u201d notes Joseph Errico, fashion director of Nylon, a fashion and culture magazine based in New York. He likes the idea of it; Errico owns a Prada pajama shirt that he bought way back in the early \u201900s. And he\u2019d use it for a fashion shoot. But he just can\u2019t see it finding a niche in real life.\n\n\u201cDoes it walk down the street or just from a chauffeured car to a private event?\u201d Errico wonders. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to break out.\u201d\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, there is no love for PJ style \u2013 not even at one of the city\u2019s great bastions of fashion, Hu\u2019s Wear.\n\n\u201cDo people even wear pajamas to bed these days?\u201d emails an incredulous Marlene Hu Aldaba from the fashion trails in Europe, where she is looking at clothes for the next season and avoiding pajamas at all costs. \u201cThis feels like another effort by designers and the fashion industry to impose some abstract vision on us \u2026 Sure, some of the softer \u2018pajama\u2019 looks are feminine and flowing, but are designers just sitting around scratching their temples trying to figure out, \u2018Where have we not been before: pajamas to dinner! That\u2019s it!\u2019 Pure shtick.\u201d\n\nThe fashion industry\u2019s fascination goes back more than a decade. In the Prada 2002 spring collection, the designer included metallic gold shirts cut precisely like a pajama top and shorts that looked like the lower half of a pajama set. And the designers Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce have for years included a few pajama looks in their runway shows.\n\nBut the trend picked up momentum in the last few seasons. \u201cAll the cool fashion editors started wearing pajamas,\u201d Errico says. They wore them with their kangaroo-fur-lined Gucci slides. They tossed C\u00e9line coats over their pajama-clad shoulders.\n\nAnd there is more to come in the season the industry calls pre-fall, notes Roopal Patel, fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. \u201cI don\u2019t think pajama dressing is going away anytime soon,\u201d she says.\n\nThere is a certain logic to it. Remember Kate Moss in her sexy Calvin Klein slip dress? Women wear camisoles as shirts and don\u2019t mind showing off an especially sexy or frilly bra. And folks delight in boarding airplanes or heading to brunch in sweatpants, leggings and T-shirts that make up in comfort what they lack in style. \u201cThere\u2019s a degree of function in athleisure,\u201d Errico says. \u201cThere\u2019s this assumption that there\u2019s a stop at a gym along the way.\u201d\n\nPajamas, however, are intimate without the sex appeal. They are all comfort without even the pretense of function. There was a period when rebellious teenagers or overtaxed parents wore their jersey or flannel sleepwear out to coffee shops or the dog park. This iteration of pajamas exuded laziness. They were a declaration of surrender \u2013 or, at their silky best, an affectation. (See: Hugh Hefner, Julian Schnabel)\n\nFashion pajamas are more complicated. They require a certain level of fashion savvy \u2013 to make clear that the look was intentional, not happenstance. That requires work. Selena Gomez was recently photographed wearing pajamas on a shopping trip. Her hair was in a low ponytail; she wore bright red lipstick and black stiletto pumps. She looked fashionable, but she did not look comfortable.\n\nStill, Patel is committed to fashion pajamas. She says they have sparked more interest in for-the-bedroom pajamas from snazzy brands like Fleur du Mal. And, yes, people really are incorporating them into their everyday lifestyle. Well, fashion people.\n\nBeware of fashion people. But if you cannot resist their siren song, Patel offers this: \u201cLayer a pajama top under a blazer with jeans and a little slipper or loafer,\u201d she says. \u201cTry a striped pajama bottom with a solid top to give it balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about having fun,\u201d she says. Whether you like it or not.",

Since then she has been arrested numerous times and was charged on counts of prostitution and resisting arrest. Just last week, Valerie was arrested again for presenting a false ID to the police and resisting arrest. When she attempted to run away, the police were forced to physically subdue her.\n\nValerie\u2019s mother, Janice, told TMZ that she has undergone rehabilitation on five separate occasions in the last five years. Her recent rehab stint occurred earlier this year just after she served time in jail for violating the terms of her probation.\n\nFairman was recently released on bail and was scheduled to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing on January 5 next year.\n\nThe Sun reports that Valerie last spoke to her mom a week and a half ago. Janice said that they didn\u2019t talk about her sobriety at the time and that nothing seemed amiss since she sounded \u201cway up\u201d and \u201cvery good.\u201d\n\nFairman\u2019s ex-boyfriend David Pryce also went on Twitter to pay tribute to the star, writing: \u201cI will always miss you Valerie and I want to tell anyone who is selling s**t to people to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have lost too many loved ones to what you are doing,\u201d he added.\n\nMany other 16 and Pregnant co-stars, such as Chelsea Houska, posted a tweet to share her condolences to Val\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cHow incredibly sad.

    "title": "Snowfall Returns To \u2018GTA Online\u2019 Alongside Free Festive Gifts",
    "text": "Free presents, a snowy map, and limited-time bonuses are now live in Grand Theft Auto V\u2019s multiplayer mode. A plethora of complimentary items are up for grabs just in time for the holidays in GTA Online. Additionally a few events and the return of snow to San Andreas and Los Santos are now also available.\n\nBy simply logging in to GTA Online on December 25, players will receive a number of free items. A unicorn mask, pajama set, fireworks launcher, a carbine rifle, a marksman rifle, some explosives, and more will be distributed to those that log in on Christmas Day.\n\nThose that log in the two days prior to the holiday or the day after will also receive a fireworks launcher and an event t-shirt for their characters according to the game\u2019s website. Of course, players can enjoy the snowy landscape right now, but the rare weather will only last until December 26.\n\n\u201cNot only does this mean you\u2019ll enjoy a picturesque holiday in GTA Online, but you\u2019ll also be able to mix it up with your friends and foes with some good old fashioned snowball fights (just press left on the D-pad to collect up to nine snowballs for your arsenal).\u201d\n\nChristmas Eve, December 24, will also offer a day-long buff to profits from vehicle exporting, any biker business sales, and CEO special cargo shipments. Players will receive a 50 percent increase in cash earned from these activities for that day only making the holiday the perfect time to pick up free gifts and make a little extra in-game money.\n\nThe new adversary mode called \u201cJuggernaut\u201d and the \u201cPlummet\u201d stunt race are also worth more RP in GTA Online until January 1 and January 2 respectively. Juggernaut pits teams against each other both working to take out the other\u2019s heavily armored target. If no team succeeds before time runs out, all players become juggernauts. Bonus cash and RP are rewards for the adversary mode while just completing the features stunt race will reward triple RP.\n\nThose free goodies, events, and a snow covered map are not the only festivities lined up for GTA Online players. Several holiday clothes are returning this year, and players can unlock them by simply logging into the game before January 9. Merry masks, Santa outfits, and appropriately hideous sweaters await those ready to celebrate the season.\n\nAlthough not tied to the Christmas holiday, a new supercar and different unlocks are also available now. The Truffade Nero car is now available at Benny\u2019s Original Motor Works. Players that jump on to the game before January 2 will also unlock the Bold Pinstripe Smoking Jacket and Pajama sets. Not to mention, a sale on GTA Online items is currently underway until January 2 as well. Players can buy two cars, two aircraft, select real estate, and a handful of products at Ammu-Nation at a 25 percent discount. For the full list of applicable items, check out the official Rockstar Games website.\n\n\u201cComing out of the holy modification temple known as Benny\u2019s Original Motor Works, the highly customizable Nero is easy on the eyes with its sleek design and also packs plenty of zip.\u201d\n\nGTA Online recently updated with the free Import/Export downloadable content just weeks ago. The latest DLC introduced a new gameplay system to steal and resell high-value vehicles. CEOs in the game can invest in expensive car garages before hiring their friends to steal luxurious automobiles to turn major profits.\n\nIn addition the new vehicle theft options and new items for the player to buy, the latest update also introduced the ability for players to change their appearance at any time via the quick menu. As the Inquisitr reported, players can access the new option by bringing up the interaction menu in-game. For $100,000 in GTA Online players can alter nearly everything about their avatar. All of the options available at character creation are also available through this option, but players cannot change their characters\u2019 gender.\n\n[Featured Image by Rockstar Games]",

    "title": "From east to west, hot destinations across Canada",
    "text": "I was lucky enough to hit eight of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories this year. From east to west, here are some thoughts about the destinations I got to see in 2016, and why you should check them out.\n\nEASTERN SHORE OF NOVA SCOTIA\n\nI had no idea the coastline northeast of Halifax was so beautiful and unpopulated. I found a few pretty villages between Liscomb and Halifax, including the wonderfully named Ecum Secum, but mostly there was rugged ocean front, craggy bays and lively art galleries. It\u2019s a place to get away from the crowds at Peggy\u2019s Cove or down in Lunenburg.\n\nTRENDY NEW BRUNSWICK\n\nI found great food at 540 Kitchen and pretty riverside parks in Fredericton, awesome kayaking near St. Andrews, a lively shopping scene and beautiful old neighbourhoods in St. John and a lively urban scene in Moncton. Not to mention long, quiet beaches and French-Canadian villages on the coast south of Miramichi. Go before everyone else discovers what the province has to offer.\n\nQUEBEC\n\nFrom the awesome spectacle of Winter Carnival in Quebec City to dogsledding near Baie St. Paul and downhill sledding (for about 7 kilometres!) at Le Massif, there\u2019s no shortage of things to do in Quebec in winter. This coming spring and summer will be just as much fun in Montreal, which is celebrating its 375th birthday with a series of parties, light shows and other big events.\n\nOTTAWA\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Ottawa will be the centre of things for Canada in 2017, our 150th birthday. This past year I managed to see the Canada Day fireworks from a fabulous viewing spot at the Fairmont Chateau Laurier. I ate twice at Navarra, my new favourite dining spot in Canada. And I saw the crazy-cool Lucky Ron show at Club Lafayette, which feels like Johnny Cash meets Stompin\u2019 Tom Connors. It\u2019s an Ottawa tradition I highly recommend.\n\nTORONTO\n\nIf you haven\u2019t dined out in Toronto lately you\u2019re missing something. Boralia is one of the coolest restaurants in the country, serving up dishes based on recipes from French explorers that date back 400 years, including mussels cooked in smoking pine needles. Try the silky ravioli at TOCA, located at the Ritz Carlton hotel. The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu complex in northwest Toronto is a stunningly beautiful spot most folks don\u2019t know about.\n\nSOUTHWEST ONTARIO\n\nAn underexposed part of the province. Muscedere Vineyards serves up delicious, deeply flavoured red wines. Amherstburg is an adorable town on the Detroit River. Windsor is dishing out great craft beer at Walkerville Brewing and Motor Craft Ales, not to mention one of Canada\u2019s tastiest burgers at Motor Burger.\n\nCALGARY\n\nChefs in Calgary these days pay more attention to perfecting the presentation of local heirloom carrots than worrying about grass-fed beef. Char Bar, in the trendy East Village area, serves up a lovely vegetable ceviche. Shokunin is a cutting-edge Japanese spot near downtown. Studio Bell at the new National Music Centre is making lots of waves for its great musical exhibits.

    "title": "Nuking Hurricanes: The Surprising History of a Really Bad Idea",
    "text": "View Images On October 11, 1961, the head of the U.S. Weather Bureau said he could \u201cimagine the possibility someday of exploding a nuclear bomb on a hurricane far at sea.\u201d\n\nPhotograph by NASA via Getty Images\n\nWhen nature declares war, who says that humanity shouldn\u2019t fight back?\n\nIt\u2019s an appealing thought, especially when, during hurricane season, we're annually reminded of the immense destruction wrought by these storms.\n\nAnd it\u2019s probably why, every year for the past six decades, government agencies have received missives from concerned citizens, urging preemptive attacks against hurricanes using nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say, this is not a good idea,\u201d says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in what is, arguably, one of the most succinct understatements on record.\n\nYet because the \u201cnuke a hurricane\u201d myth won\u2019t die, NOAA maintains a web page exclusively devoted to debunking this proposal. (Similarly, the U.S. Geological Survey has an online report debunking divining rods and water dowsing. It\u2019s not always easy being a government scientist.)\n\nTo be fair, though, there was a time when scientists and government agencies were themselves seriously considering the nuclear option. In a speech delivered at the National Press Club on October 11, 1961, Francis W. Riechelderfer, the head of the U.S. Weather Bureau, said he could \u201cimagine the possibility someday of exploding a nuclear bomb on a hurricane far at sea.\u201d (Although, comfortingly, Riechelderfer added that the Weather Bureau would not begin acquiring its own nuclear arsenal \u201cuntil we know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d)\n\nThe idea of nuking a storm was also on the minds of Texans that same year, after the state was struck by a Category 5 hurricane that caused more than two billion dollars in damage.\n\n\u201cCould Hurricane Carla have been broken up, or greatly modified, or its course turned back to sea, by nuclear bombs?,\u201d asked an editorial in the Longview Daily News. \u201cThe suggestion that man-made explosions may effect [sic] hurricanes cannot be dismissed with the same degree of certainty on the basis of energy comparisons as was possible with earlier atomic weapons.\u201d\n\nIn other words, America now had the hydrogen bomb, which was a thousand times more powerful than the atomic bombs that had been dropped on Japan. Couldn't this energy be unleashed as a hurricane killer?\n\nJack W. Reed, a meteorologist at Sandia Laboratory, thought so. In fact, he came up with the idea while studying the atmospheric effects produced by America\u2019s first detonation of a hydrogen bomb, which had lifted a massive column of air more than 20 miles into the sky.\n\nReed had the opportunity to present his research at various conferences, notably the 1959 symposium on the Plowshare Program\u2014a government initiative to develop \u201cpeaceful\u201d uses for nuclear weapons in science and industry. (Some of the most infamous Plowshare proposals included plans to use nukes to create an instant harbor on the coast of Alaska and to excavate a new Panama Canal.)\n\nIn his paper, Reed speculated that a submarine could travel underwater to penetrate the eye of a hurricane, where it would launch and detonate one or more nuclear missiles. The ensuing explosion would loft most of the relatively warm air in the hurricane's eye high above the storm into the stratosphere. The warm air would then be replaced by colder, denser air\u2014reducing the wind speed and weakening the storm.\n\nReed calculated that a 20 megaton explosion could slow a storm with 100-knot peak winds to 50 knots.\n\nBut Reed didn\u2019t find any takers for his idea. The research would require setting off multiple nukes at several million dollars a pop. Government officials expressed concern that bombing hurricanes would conflict with U.S. efforts to end atmospheric nuclear tests.\n\nAnd, there\u2019s also the slight problem that\u2014in the words of Robert Nelson, a physicist who studies nuclear weapons\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s just wacky.\u201d\n\nFor starters, as NOAA observes, there\u2019s the issue of radioactive fallout, which would \u201cfairly quickly move with the trade winds to affect land areas and cause devastating environmental problems.\u201d\n\nAlso, it wouldn\u2019t work. The key obstacle is the amount of energy required. The heat release from a hurricane is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes, NOAA calculates. In order to shrink a Category 5 hurricane into a Category 2 hurricane, you would have to add about a half ton of air for each square yard inside the eye, or a total of a bit more than half a billion (500,000,000) tons for an eye 25 miles in diameter. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to envision a practical way of moving that much air around,\u201d NOAA says.",

    "text": "Because many seniors in an Elgin housing complex can't get out to acquire fresh food, a food pantry is bringing it to them.\n\nIn a partnership among the Housing Authority of Elgin, Senior Services Associates and Food For Greater Elgin, a \"Fresh to You Mobile Market\" will provide food to the Central Park Towers apartments along Route 31 every third Friday of the month.\n\n\"For low-income seniors and people with disabilities, it can be extremely difficult to secure adequate transportation to get to our facility,\" said Michelle Frampton, executive director of Food For Greater Elgin. \"We not only aimed at providing shelf stable items, but also on bringing plentiful fresh and frozen food options that people could select for themselves based on the foundations of choice and dignity Food For Greater Elgin is built upon.\"\n\nHousing Authority CEO Damon Duncan said, \"At the Housing Authority of Elgin, we take our mission very seriously. We have provided a very high quality of housing, and now the added component of the Greater Elgin food and nutrition program makes Central Park Towers a preferred and desired residence in the city of Elgin.\"\n\nCentral Park Tower has 164 affordable and market rate housing units.

Without this service being here, many of us would not be able to make it throughout the month with food.\"\n\nColman and more than 75 other residents were able to get household items, a variety of produce, meats, meals, breads, and other foods at the December event, according to a press release.\n\n\"We are beyond thrilled to work with Housing Authority and Senior Services to bring the spirit of the season to all of these wonderful people, now and throughout the year.\" Frampton said.\n\nFood For Greater Elgin officials say an average of 1,200 households were served per month, equating to nearly 6,000 individuals, half of whom are children.\n\nFor more information on Food For Greater Elgin and the Fresh to You Market program see, www.FoodForGreaterElgin.org or phone 847-931-9330.\n\nCourier-News reporter Mike Danahey contributed to this article.",

    "title": "Never Again \u2013 Time For Zero Tolerance For Impunity And Corruption",
    "text": "\u201cWe cannot build an economy where corruption is the working capital\u201d\n\n\u2014 Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria\n\n\u201cDemocracies can no longer tolerate bribery, fraud and dishonesty; especially as such practices disproportionately hurt the poor\u201d.\n\n\u2014 Jimmy Carter, former President of the USA\n\nSo the criminal gang made up of greedy bastards, old evil dwarfs, babies with sharp teeth, thieves, stealers, leeches, liars, propagandists, team B players; the people who created well-oiled corruption machineries to loot and share the nation\u2019s wealth to the discomfort of the entire nation and to their own advantage have been booted out of political office? Majority of the people in this country could not believe that it would happen. Not that the people of this country had any faith that the NDC, formed by capitalists of socialist pretences out of the rampaging mob of the PNDC could genuinely win any free and fair elections. But the NDC held all the aces close to its chest in the December 7, 2016. Looking at its history, the NDC had been formed out of the PNDC using stolen national resources, the first political party in this country to be so formed. For a political party which could not pay its rent while in opposition, and within two years of gaining power, it was able to put up an ultra-modern national headquarters reputedly worth 20 million United States dollars in a prime area in Accra tells a story of fraud, corruption and evil mechanisation.\n\nAs if that was not enough, the NDC has always used stolen national resources to finance its political campaigns. It uses stolen national resources not only to purchase pickups which are distributed liberally among all its parliamentary candidates to aid them in their electioneering campaigning backed by sizable unaccountable monetary imprest to boot. The party erects clearly out of sight offensive billboards at vantage points and also buys items ranging from mundane household items like chamber pots and head pans to expensive four wheel vehicles and estate houses all from state resources for distribution to the electorates all in the quest to influence their voting. During the 2012 elections alone, the corrupt, incompetent, ethnocentric, nepotistic, greedy John Dramani Mahama NDC administration squandered over nine billon cedis of the nation\u2019s resources to finance its electioneering campaign. The nation is still counting the cost of the money stolen this time around during this year\u2019s elections. No doubt the amount will far exceed the figures for 2012 judging from the obscene manner in which frivolous but expensive freebies were tossed around in a distribution campaign led by the lady of the house.\n\nThere were other extenuating factors which made most Ghanaians develop goose pimples and had fright that the NDC was going to win the elections, albeit, through illegal and dubious means and that only spiritual and heavenly intervention and eternal vigilance on the part of the citizens could prevent that from happening. In the first place, the Electoral Commission, which is meant to be an independent objective referee, in actual fact, by all its acts of commission and omission leading to the elections and during the elections, portrayed itself as an organisation with a leadership populated by a batch of golliwogs and stringed puppets dancing to the tune of the NDC in a manner as if possessed by the devil. The Electoral Commissioners turned deaf ears to all meaningful suggestions coming from outside the NDC camp. As if the divisive stand of the Electoral Commission was not enough, the state security services which were expected to provide security to all manner of persons rather behaved as if the leadership formed part of the apron strings of the NDC providing selective injustice, protecting NDC crime perpetrators and picking up non-NDC supporters for no just causes. Thus, when the leadership of the security services visited Nana Akufo Addo, after he had won the presidential election, I thought they went there with copies of their resignation letters. I was surely disappointed by the hypocritical and the U-turn attitude and a dog in a manger behavior.\n\nAgain, the Peace Council which was supposed to calm waters and provide a soothing balm for flayed nerves of the worried citizens rather chose to behave like the proverbial ostrich. It completely either turned blind eyes to the atrocities which were committed by the rampaging apparatchiks of the NDC or issued meaningless innocuous statements whenever evil was perpetrated by NDC members and sympathisers and only woke up when persons belonging to the non-NDC party appeared to be at fault. Is it not interesting and very intuitive that it was only on the day when the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission faced the TV cameras to announce the result of the presidential elections that Ghanaians first got to know the faceless operators behind the Electoral Commission. I heard somebody exclaim in amazement that he did not know that five of the seven Commissioners were women with all the seven with unknown fixed addresses. How could the nation leave the most sensitive institution of the state in the hands of persons who do not appear to have known addresses?\n\nAgain how come only a retired Head of the Methodist Church is the only visible face of the Peace Council when we still harbor the idea of the gallant refusal of the former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church to accept bribes of V8 vehicle, a house at Trassacco Valley and US$100,000 to join the evil and satanic camp of the NDC? Today if the NDC is licking its wounds, it is not because the party lost the elections but because the leadership is still at sea as to how after all the massive rigging machinery the party put in place, the system could not guarantee the party election victory. A fool once said in his heart there is no God. So is it a fact that the rainbow coalition of the greedy bastards, the old evil dwarfs, the babies with sharp teeth, the liars, the propagandist, the thieves, the stealers, the people who created well-oiled corruption machineries to loot and share the nation\u2019s wealth have been booted out of political office? Yes it is true, no matter how unbelievable it might sound. That was the battle. The war to be fought is to install zero tolerance for impunity and corruption in our body politics and society, something which we lost during the 27 years of atrocious poetical adventure under the PNDC?NDC evil political conglomerate.\n\nE \u2013 mail: makgyasi@ug.edu.gh\n\nBY Kwame Gyasi",

    "text": "March 13, 2015 Comments (3) Views: 4141 Comics, Nerds\n\nBeing a gay teenager is rough. Trying to figure out your sexuality and place in the world is super tricky in those formative years. It\u2019s especially rough if you\u2019re on the run from your super-villain parents. That last part might only apply to you if you\u2019re Karolina Dean from Marvel\u2019s Runaways.\n\nKarolina (or Lucy in the Sky as she\u2019s sometimes referred to), is one of the original members of the Runaways group. Her parents were members of the villainous Pride that controlled most of California until her and her fellow Runaways put a stop to them. Karolina\u2019s a member of the Majesdanian alien race, which she only discovers after fleeing from her parents. While maintaining a human form, Karolina can transform to her Majesdanian form, which contains a beautiful mixture of light and colors. In this form, Karolina can manipulate solar energy stored in her body and focus it into blasts or force fields. She can also fly.\n\nAfter a few adventures with the Runaways, Karolina finally comes out to their leader Nico by kissing her. Unfortunately, the advance is unwanted, making for an awkward situation. There\u2019s not a lot of time to deal with it, as Karolina\u2019s fiance enters the picture. Xavin is a Super-Skrull, promised to Karolina to unite their two races when the two become old enough. He introduces himself as a male, but when Karolina admits she\u2019s gay (to him, and the rest of the Runaways for the first time), he simply changes his gender.\n\nKarolina leaves with Xavin to unite their people, but the two eventually rejoin the team as a couple. However, the two are broken up when Xavin disguises herself as Karolina, to take her place for crimes against Majesdanians. Runaways hasn\u2019t had an ongoing series since 2009, but Karolina has had a few minor appearances in other comics. Hopefully this will change with the new Runaways series set to debut later this year.\n\nHave a gay character you\u2019d like to see in the spotlight?

    "text": "Britain is braced for the arrival of Storm Barbara, with winds of 90mph expected to batter some parts of the country.\n\nForecasters are warning that wintry showers, strong winds and lightning could lead to disruption to power supplies and travel across the north-west of the UK.\n\nThe Met Office has issued severe weather warnings for many parts of Britain, with Scotland expected to bear the brunt of the storm.\n\nAn amber \u201cbe prepared\u201d wind warning is in place for northern and western parts of Scotland for Friday afternoon, evening and overnight into Christmas Eve.\n\nTwo separate Yellow \u201cbe aware\u201d wind warnings are in place, one covering northern parts of the UK where gusts of 60 to 70mph are expected quite widely, and one for more southern areas, where a narrow and intense band of heavy rain and gusty winds could lead to some disruption.\n\nFlood alerts are also in place for the Highlands and Western Isles, as well as Skye and the Scottish Borders.\n\nBrent Walker, Met Office deputy chief meteorologist, said: \u201cStorm Barbara is crossing the Atlantic and will pass close to the north-west of the UK during Friday, bringing the potential for some disruption to power supplies and travel, and possibly structural damage.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish Government said it is being regularly updated on the expected impact on travel across the country.\n\nThe rest of Scotland, pockets of Northern Ireland, north Wales and the north of England are also due to feel the force of Storm Barbara on Friday.\n\nScotland\u2019s transport minister Humza Yousaf said: \u201cMinisters are getting regular updates on the status of Storm Barbara and the likely impacts, with gusts of 90mph expected across the far north of the country on Friday where the Met Office has an amber warning in place.\n\n\u201cThe safety of the travelling public is our main concern and services will run where possible, but planning in advance is essential and people should leave plenty of time for journeys and consider the conditions and when they travel.\u201d\n\nScotRail said that due to the severe weather conditions forecast, speed restrictions and a small number of service withdrawals will take place as a safety precaution on Friday.\n\nIt said that as some trains will be travelling at slower rates, their journey times will be extended and service levels on some lines in the south, west and north will have to be reduced as a result.\n\nSouth of the border, councils were said to be \u2018\u2019fully prepared\u2019\u2019 for the onset of harsh conditions over Christmas.\n\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), which represents hundreds of councils in England and Wales, said it was issuing renewed advice on how to deal with flash floods and has stockpiled more than one million tonnes of salt to grit roads.\n\nEnvironment spokesman Martin Tett said: \u2018\u2019Councils are fully prepared to protect residents and minimise disruption caused by Storm Barbara and other potential bad weather such as snow and flooding.\n\n\u201cCouncil staff will be out in force clearing roads of any debris and damage.\u2019\u2019",
